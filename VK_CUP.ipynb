Some extra points can be deducted for the fact that they stopped using hangul for several hundred years until it was institutionalized by the strong nationalist movement post WWII and made the official writing system in an effort to establish a unique Korean culture. Additionally we can pause curiously while noting that the average Korean still uses 700-800 Chinese kanji in daily life, and that academic papers still use the kanji for particularly esoteric or complex concepts (although this is increasingly discouraged as it is viewed as elitism). He crucifies Joel and Don for using limited examples to justify a point... and then use a single example to prove his, along with unsubstantiated claims about linguistic researchers.

I joined a startup straight out of college as employee #13 (at the time, it had about 8 employees in the office at any given time).  It was profitable, I liked the people, and they were doing some pretty cool stuff.Overall, I would do it over again but probably will not remain with them for much longer, if that makes any sense.   Some observations:The language choice will grate on you after a while.  I dunno what the background of posters saying \\\"Be professional.  Suck it up.\\\" is, but I actually liked Java coding when I started, and have since learned to hate it.  If you''re going in with a strong aversion to Java &#38; C++ already, it''ll probably only get worse.Flip side is that you do get better at these languages after you work with them a while, as long as you keep an open mind.  There are tricks and tools in C++ to help you manage memory - you shouldn''t be tracing pointers from new to delete.  And Java''s verbosity isn''t as bad once you get used it and consider \\\"for(int i = 0; i &#60; array.length; ++i)....\\\" to be a single map function that just has a really long name. ;-)One question to ask that''ll help you determine if the language will end up becoming a total drag: are they using it because the problem fits the language''s strengths, or are they using it because they don''t know any better and aren''t comfortable with multi-language solutions?  Every mainstream language is good for something.  In my case, I was perfectly happy as long as I was writing IDE plugins and server software in Java, and then became very unhappy once I had to write a webapp.  (IMNSHO, Java is irredeemably broken for webapps; the only sane way to do them is to strip out all the JavaEE bullshit and program on bare servlets, but then you get something that''s nowhere near as nice as Python\\/PHP\\/Perl.)There are plenty of things beyond programming that you learn from working in a successful (profitable) startup.  OTOH, it''s not rocket science.  Basically, you can boil it all down to: 1.) Make something people want, 2.) Charge more for it than it costs you, and 3.) Fix problems now rather than later.  Every failed startup I''ve been involved with has neglected at least one of these: every successful startup has done all three.I dunno what you expect financially out of this, but be aware that founders get rich, late-stage employees get paid, and early-stage employees get screwed.  At least in proportion to the amount of effort they put in.  One startup I worked in went bust, taking my 0.1% of stock options with it.  One that I interviewed at offered me about 0.01% of the company; I did the math, and calculated that at their expected $40M exit, I would get a whole $4000.  I have no equity at my current employer.  My cubemate was an early employee at CCBN, which was sold to Thomson for about $40M.  He got $3K or so.  I have another friend who was employee #35 at Stratus and later a VP; she was rich for a while when they ended up with a billion-$ market cap, but ended up poor again after the stock crashed.  If you plan on being an early employee at a startup, you should do it for learning or for the experience rather than any perceived financial rewards.',0);\n",

Talk about the points you mention above, and then bring it full circle by telling them that any road they walk down can be equally fulfilling if they find something they truly care for: life''s value derives from what we do, not what we have.\\nHope your talk goes well, and keep in mind there is probably a reason you are being asked to give a talk and not me. ;\n",

Lighttpd can do a few things: it does fast cgi (fcgi support explains about 75% of the examples in that list), it can serve static files, and it can proxy requests to other servers. Lighttpd doesn''t \\\"support Mongrel\\\", because Mongrel is another server. What Lighttpd does is use something akin to mod_proxy to send certain requests somewhere else, that somewhere else might be a Mongrel cluster that is running on port 8080 (hence it \\\"supports\\\" Mongrel).\\nThat proxying service is where the majority of Lighttpd usage has been. A typical efficient setup these days (YouTube does along these lines) is to have lighttpd accept incoming requests and if the request is for a static file then it serves the request (because it is very lightweight (i.e. minimal) it is more efficient than Apache at serving static media), and if it is for dynamic content the request is passed to Apache, which then passes it back to Lighttpd, which passes it back to the requester (this means that \\\"heavy\\\" Apache threads will be dedicated to a request for a shorter period of time since it only has to communicate\\/wait for Lighttpd instead of the actual requester).\\nLighttpd on its own isn''t necessarily the best solution (an example from my experience is that mod_python and Apache become more efficient at serving dynamic content than fcgi and Lighttpd as the numbers of requester per second get very high). Usually a combination of a light frontend server and Apache in the backend can provide the best performance (again this is at high numbers, at lower numbers lighttpd is probablly equally or more efficient).\\nAs a final note, I''d really recommend Nginx over Lighttpd if you are looking for a light http server to serve static content, support fcgi, and\\/or proxy to other servers. The biggest reason? Lighttpd leaks memory and has to be restarted occasionally because every couple of days (under heavy usage) it dies. Not a great feature in a production server.', 0);\n",

There are all kinds of security and manageability problems with that. Already, there are many buggy Firefox plugins that cripple the browser, effectively causing a DOS attack with crashes and decreased performance. This is a good indication that we should not have confidence in Firefox''s abilities to manage third party applications. Really Firefox should be in that business at all, since resource allocation and crash prevention are fundamentally operating system features. The right solution is to improve the installation experience provided by the operating system, and have it provide security-oriented integration capabilities for applications (as opposed to to the performance-oriented integration capabilities we have now). This would require the operating system to provide a sandboxed environment by default to downloaded applications. The OS needs to provide a middle ground between the almost unrestricted access given to today''s downloaded applications, and the totally restricted access given to web apps; that access needs to be very close to the web app side.With this kind of severely-limited sandbox, we can then eliminate the whole UI of application installation.

Their docs talk about the login process but are silent on explaining the difference between login vs. install which leads to this madness about \\\"infinite sessions\\\". All it means is if the user installs your application == infinite session. If user \\\"logs into\\\" your application == 24 hour session. Needless to say it is easier if user installed your application, again not mentioned in the docs.Oh and another thing, Facebook does not save application data for you. Saving user settings and data is totally your problem to solve. It''d be nice if Facebook had an API to stash just a little bit of data for each app user but no dice....oh and finally try submitting your application to the product directory... SORRY! Your application needs to have at least 5 users before it will be listed!! How does an application that hasn''t lanuched yet and isn''t even listed get 5 users??? Such are the mysteries of Facebook.

Every week on YCombinator Startup News, somebody asks about learning Lisp to do a web app, when there are way more other things to worry about than the language.  Use something you want to use every day, not just in theory because someone else did.  I''d learn an unknown language if I was at a startup that used it every day, but otherwise, I would default to using a web framework that I have already used in the past.My conclusion is that if you''re creating a web application using a web framework in any language you find interesting at the moment, go for it.  Because that''s exactly what Paul did.  It just happened to be Lisp that he was an expert at, but it could have been any other exciting technology.Whether Paul would use Lisp today or not on a new project is irrelevant as far as your plate is concerned.  He could use Lisp, but it wouldn''t mean that there aren''t other good alternatives.

''Marketing companies'' are sometimes profitable, but rarely maintain a commanding market position for long if they get there in the first place. Contrast these with the real product companies of our time: Apple, Google, Craigslist, Facebook, Toyota. The real profit and value are being created by companies who focus on actual products.

The collection can never exceed the capacity of the one decent-sized bookshelf.Every August, I take an inventory of everything I own and how often I''m using it. This includes books, clothes, office supplies, everything. Everything gets divided into three categories based on usage: heavily used, not used at all, and marginal. I keep everything in the ''heavily used'' category. I sell, give away, or throw away everything in the ''never used'' category. Then, I make a list of everything in the ''marginal'' category and keep it until the next year. If any given item is still ''marginal'' the next year, I sell it.You''d be surprised how effective this is. What''s especially amazing is the crazy stuff you can sell over the net - someone paid 50 bucks for a t-shirt I hadn''t worn in 15 years. Last year I made enough cash doing this to buy a new Mac.

If Facebook''s users all left the site tomorrow, it would obviously be bad for Facebook, but the rest of the industry would break out the champagne.

Clothing styles turn over just as quickly as Web fads, but fashion designers still manage to stay in business for decades. You just have to operate at a higher level.

For people who don''t have the ability to succeed in \\\"socially acceptable\\\" fields, it usually takes the form of crime.

This is not because his ability level has decreased - Marc''s article suggests that quality of work remains constant.  Rather, it''s because he has no reason to.   He''s already reproduced, and likely found a lifetime mate.  His children''s genetic legacy is set in stone.  There''s no reason for him to expend the extra energy needed to perform at the top of his game.Curiously, men that continue to produce at top-of-the-field levels also seem to have multiple successive wives\\/lovers.

We''re all entrepreneurs and love building businesses.  We put in our sweat first and foremost and happen to invest sufficient capital as well.  We only invest our time and money where we can add value. \\n2.\\tWe offer deep business development and technical skills and an extensive network.  We work as the extended team so the startup can stay small but still have the right quality and quantity of talent.3.\\tWe love the YC approach of supporting entrepreneurs and drew inspiration from their model.  That being said, there are some key differences.  Namely, we get actively involved in each business. We invest funds to carry the company for two years to a potential exit or to a high growth trajectory. And, like YC, we leave open the possibility of a small, early acquisition as exit.  As we all know, this is a likely outcome these days, even though the VCs don''t like them.4.\\tBecause of our involvement we can get involved with founders whose plans are still nascent, and sometimes we''ll help put founders together on a business. To us the entrepreneurs are more important than the idea itself.5.\\tWe typically look for technical founders who have a knack for understanding what their users want and then delivering it quickly.  We don''t encourage outsourcing development unless it''s just for commodity components of the overall service.6.\\tWe don''t consider anyone a \\\"reject\\\" because a fund passed them by.  We''ll evaluate each team and business on its own merits and go for it if we like the people, think we can add a lot of value, and believe we can build a valuable business together.  Obviously, each group of founders has to decide the same on its side.7.\\tTandem is brand new, but we have a lot of experience at building startups.  We''ve made two investments thus far and with three principals only plan to do about 6 per year.  In many ways, Tandem is a startup itself in that we''re breaking the traditional model, having a blast, taking encouragement and support with open arms, and proceeding full steam ahead regardless of what certain \\\"established\\\" parties in venture finance say.8.\\tWe are happy to entertain folks that have gone through the YC process as well as those that are entering it.

Why did Reddit and Digg descend into their present state?I think something other than \\\"the userbase has grown\\\" is going on here. I think one major reason is that you see others'' opinions before you decide your own. As a general rule, any Internet poll prompts you to vote before showing you the running results, to attempt to preserve independence of opinion. Reddit and Digg, however, breach this.Secondly, in both Reddit and Digg, any controversial item leaves public sight; only those items that most approve of reach and stay in the front. Those items only of great appeal to a subsection of the user base either fail to reach and stay in the top, and, as a result, simpler items with more general appeal begin to dominate the front.For Reddit; this was the rise of political articles; for Digg, which I am less familiar with, I''d imagine it involved less technically in-depth items.The above system accelerates; as content begins to represent the cross-section of the interests of a larger, more diverse group, the site attracts an even larger, even more-diverse group.The squashing of controversy and propagation of opinion combine so that commenting maintains a status quo: The posts that are upmodded are known to be upmodded, and, thus newcomers will associate these types of posts with being worthy of upmods and will upmod them themselves. Due to the desire for social status, those newcomers bold enough to begin making comments of their own attempt to imitate the style accepted by the community as \\\"upmod-worthy.\\\" And thus, newcomers learn to achieve a style that causes their posts to be upmodded.The above two points combine: The oldtimers tolerated newcomers; the newcomers tolerated newer-comers; due to the logistical nature of the system, each \\\"generation\\\" outnumbers the previous. The newer-comers whom the oldtimers indirectly \\\"let in\\\" may create comments repulsive to many of the oldtimers that get upmodded to the top; this slowly disillusions the relevant oldtimers, causing them to leave, solidifying the community''s shift.And there, that''s Digg, according to my understanding. I must admit I''ve used Digg little and do not have a firm grasp on how its system works, so everything I say about Digg should be taken with a grain of salt; on Reddit, I am more confident in my ability to speak truthfully.Reddit''s story goes further: In Reddit, a controversial item where one side has an advantage can reach the front page. Thus, assuming it involves the general cross section of readers, the ideology that originally had an upper hand will get its content to the front and the opposing ideologues, primarily reading items they disagree with, leave. The former ideology solidifies its hold; future opponents of said ideology get discouraged from joining; groupthink evolves.And thus, my theory for the state of Reddit today. Reddit''s original techie audience created the status quo of commenting style. They drew in their friends and peers from various communities via word of mouth. The new users tolerated and contributed to the technical articles that were reddit''s genesis; the techies tolerated and contributed to the nontechnical articles being brought in. The cycle occurred again, and, though the technical bias in the community was preserved through visible, active posters, a shift toward articles with broader appeal was well underway.  Since the original techie user base likely contained more liberals and libertarians than conservatives, the former two  ideologies, both of which involve laypeople and can be associated with most topics, began to heavily get their content into the front. Liberalism and libertarianism tolerate each other somewhat, but liberalism was stronger due to its numerical advantage among the general populace. The hold of liberalism expanded as outlined.As one might expect from the above paragraph, the front page of the Reddit of today has articles on healthcare, global warming, and other politicized material; some items supporting Ron Paul; and a whole bunch of items with broad but shallow appeal, such as pictures of cats.', 0);\n",

The oldies were talking about \\\"back in the day\\\" just like the old diggers. Spawning a new Wikipedia-like system isn''t going to work; Citizendium is not the answer. You can spawn a new digg and it would still face the same problems. You can talk about spawning a new news.yc for non-startup content, and assuming it gets popular, it would still run into quality control problems. Plus, pg has a sizeable following, but there is only one of him: unless he clones himself for the new site, or creates a different system, his divested energy will result in one being less active than the other.A community news site that handles 10K users isn''t going to handle 1M users similarly just by scaling the system or by implementing friends and leaders. There''s that rule of 150 written in the Tipping Point book that says any group exceeding about 150 members will become difficult to manage(I shouldn''t cite Gladwell but it''s not an unfounded idea). A site of thousands of active members will, of course, run into management problems, but with a 10:90 active:lurker ratio, it works ok when your site has up to perhaps 20k users before you see any substantial, visible change in focus. Since not every user is active at the same time of day, you can increase the size of the virtual community, perhaps to something like 300 core members before the content changes dramatically.I don''t know digg''s numbers, but taking wikipedia as an example, with thousands of active editors, of course you will run into problems!

At all. It never has, and it never will. Those photos you took are pointless. If pictures are worth a thousand words, then people are worth a billion photos. A few photos a day just can''t capture what you''re thinking, the social context, the general mood, your thoughts and feelings, the state of the economy, foreign relations, what you just did 5 minutes prior, what you just ate, what your friends are up to off-camera, if the person next to you smells like they''re drunk, the charge on your cell phone, your status with friends and family, etc.Photos give the illusion of defining you at a point in time, but they are NOT a virtual machine or an environment like Squeak--they''re just a screen shot--and not what the person''s doing, either, but what what''s visible for that split second of time.The big problem, then, is that people judge themselves by what they would look like if somebody were to take a photo of them, and not by where they''re going. In fact, people are doing everything they can to impede where they''re going--buying anti-age cremes, spending money so they don''t have to take the responsibility of saving it, which might otherwise make them feel older. So, people are always focusing on looking like they have never made any progress in their lives.However, when traveling through life--whether by car, aging, networking, degrees, promotions, dating)--it doesn''t matter where you actually are. At all. It never has, and it never will.The only two things that matter are the direction and velocity. Therefore, you always have to make the best choices you can for your life, when buying things, socializing, and business. Look at what''s stopping you, decide your options, and pick the best overall choice, and if you really can''t see a better way, then do the option that is easier. Then move on. Life is better than any video game because you have infinite choices in infinite areas. The key is to hurry up and make a choice, and move on to the other 230 trillion choices you have.If you know you like a shirt, and the fit and price range is good, but you can''t decide between red and blue, pick one randomly and move on.

Almost everyone has room to do their job better.  The direction you should take your career will become more obvious after you do that.  In my experience, these are the biggest obstacles to loving what you do:- Being pessimistic yourself.- Being surrounded by pessimistic people.- Working for pessimistic management.- Dealing with a poor physical work environment.- Forgetting to aggressively attempt hard problems.Sometimes, you''ll hit a wall.  It can''t ALL come from within (though some Bhuddists may disagree).  I unloaded trucks in a warehouse for a few months after college, and while it was rewarding to get stronger and satisfying to work very quickly, it was clear that there would be very little change approaching infinity, and I could not do this the rest of my life.  In my last job, I was beginning to notice a similar wall, but more importantly it was fairly clear that management both did not enjoy working with technology, and did not enjoy managing employees within the framework of the company.  They did not enjoy dealing with bureaucracy, yet it was forced on them often.  This resulted in consistently poor morale.  Even when we thought morale was good, it was bad by the standards of the company I work fow now.  It happened so gradually that all of a sudden one day I noticed that the thought of going to work made me sick to me stomach.

It''s easy to set up an event or fundraiser, invite everyone you know, put up pictures about the event, and so on. Many comments show that there are expectations for use cases that Facebook really isn''t about. \\\"Having hundreds of ''friends'' is pointless.\\\" \\\"...looking for dates...met someone interesting...\\\" That''s not what Facebook is about, nor intended to be.Yep, you can stay in touch with your close friends on Facebook if you really want. Many people do. But, it''s really about those hundreds of people you still care about, but you don''t see on a regular basis. It is the best way to keep tabs on them. It''s also great for setting plans with them. As a personal side note, Facebook has led to several happy reunions with old friends after I lost their contact information for years.More about the idea of \\\"Facebook is casual\\\". Facebook messages have injected themselves between email and IM on the formality spectrum, and wall posts are now between Messages and IM. You can initiate conversation with people who would otherwise find it odd. Like, say, members of the attractive sex. The common theme is that Facebook pleases our in-born psychological social instincts. It is a fine lesson in human factors. Yet more. The cool kids are on facebook. You know, the ones that we''re supposed to hate as self-respecting geeks, because we''re smarter but they somehow have more fun? That means people who care about being cool get on Facebook. (Although rebellion is cool, so now it''s cool to take a stand against Facebook and stay off. But that''s a whole other story.)It''s a perfectly acceptable social norm to \\\"Facebook-stalk\\\" someone: To look up their interests when you''re interested in them. That''s a big one. It''s a handy, casual way of passing around contact information. Once you know someone''s name and a little bit about them, you can find them on Facebook. You don''t need to ask for their phone number or IM or email address, find somewhere to write it down, and take 30 awkward seconds to do it. You just say, \\\"Let''s find each other on Facebook.\\\" To be clear: Facebook makes it just a little bit easier to pick up. Also, friending is a no-cost way of sending goodwill.So that''s why people use Facebook.People on this discussion board love news about Facebook because Facebook is every tech entrepreneur''s wet dream. Zuckerberg is young, modest, smart and very, very rich. Startup founders love to dream about Facebook-like success because that''s what they all want. It''s intellectual masturbation. When someone posts insights about Facebook''s success, instant nerdgasm. Also, Facebook is an important enough influence on mainstream digital life that few Web entrepreneurs can ignore it. Facebook app clones can kill fledgling independent applications fast. And if Facebook manages to get people used to spending money while on Facebook, they could rival Google, Amazon, and Ebay in importance. Finally, a note about the ''stolen idea''. Let''s ignore that where the idea came from is irrelevant to Facebook''s current utility and success. You ought to realize that ideas are near-worthless and execution is everything. FB is a case study in excellent execution. They hire brilliant developers just like Joel says, and they built a very clean UI as a competitive advantage over Myspace. Nearly all successful businesses are based on incremental improvements on existing ideas with great execution. Put it this way: \\\"Online store\\\" is not terribly creative, but pg is rich and famous today because his gang of hackers had the best execution in building one. Search engines were not a new idea when Google took over the world. Nor were operating systems or word processors when Microsoft did before that. Online social networks were not new.

It might take until the Sun goes Red Giant to run your single lifetime simulation.The speed of light is a convenience for updating the simulation in discrete steps.

Properly implemented and convincing, we can do away with suffering altogether.  We can \\\"live\\\" in a world that seems fully real, but in which no-one is actually suffering because everyone else is simulated.  All our needs are met and all our desires are fulfilled.The mistake we keep making is that in order to create convincing AIs to inhabit the world with us, they actually become as sentient and conscious as we are; being virtual is no barrier to feelings or emotions!  [1]Thus our creations want to create a simulation to live in themselves, so they won''t suffer, either, and so it goes like a perpetual zoom on a fractal set.[1] To convince yourself of this, consider a matter replicator that copies every single atom in your body.  You''d create a clone.  It would be thinking and feeling just as you do.  Now consider a computer simulation of a single atom; if that can be done, then by extension, it would be possible to simulate anything made of atoms.  A simulated clone of you would also behave the same.  The neurological activity that occurs in your \\\"real\\\" brain when you feel or think would also occur across the virtual atoms in the brain of your virtual clone.  In fact, that would involve real electrical activity taking place among real atoms making up the RAM chips and CPUs \\\"containing\\\" the simulation of the virtual clone.  Thus any simulation at the same scope or nesting level as yourself is as real as you are and therefore its feelings are just as valid. [2][2] By further extension, if your simulations are as real as you are, then your simulation''s simulations are as real as it is, and thus a simulation at any nesting level is as real as one at any other -- a simulation inside a simulation is still running on real atoms with real electricity!\\n', 1);\n",

There is also an additional bureaucratic and testing cost. These costs are in addition to running the programs themselves, but _these_ costs specifically antagonize other political entities in the school district.And of course... unlike special ed, teachers resent busing away their best students. They fight over dumping the worst, of course.Politically (within the district) gifted education is a career for pariahs. They create hassle for the \\\"normal\\\" (aka \\\"real\\\") teachers and they have no power to deter neglect or abuse. The teachers and staff in the department are paid less than require more education than \\\"real\\\" teachers. This drives away the best teaching talent and firmly entrenches the some least ambitious teachers within the department. The curriculum is a petri dish of all sorts of inane pet political agendas. Especially in science and math, the teachers don''t know the subjects themselves, so these subjects simply aren''t taught beyond a pre-packaged lesson plan.The consequence: the most qualified students leave the district (if they can.) Instead of integration, communities become more and more segregated. Fact is, if you don''t \\\"segregate\\\" special resources for the best within a community, the best will leave. School districts only have incentives to reduce segregation with their local district.

There will be some overlap, but obviously they won''t all think the same things - then they''d really be brainwashed.Unfortunately, there''s only one way that things actually are.  So somehow you''ve got to condense the myriad of different cultures, beliefs and desires into a single reality.  Governments have relied on various ways of accomplishing this:1.) Kill everyone who doesn''t agree with the \\\"official\\\" culture.  Eg. Rwanda, Bosnia, Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany, U.S. conquest of Native Americans2.) Kill the most vocal proponents of alternate viewpoints, enough to terrorize the remaining citizens into keeping with the party line.  Eg. modern Russia, several South American governments, apartheid South Africa3.) Convince the population that eternal damnation awaits anyone who disagrees with the party line.  Eg. the Catholic Church4.) Split the population into many little populations, each of which can have their own reality.  Eg. former Yugoslavia, former Soviet Union, American Civil War, Roman Empire.  Problem with this is that each sub-state still wants to impose its reality upon its neighbors, so you often get continual warfare until one gobbles up the others.5.) Convince a majority of the population that they really agree with you.  This is the \\\"discrimination and brainwashing\\\" you refer to.6.) Develop some fundamental principles that everybody agrees on, then agree to disagree on the specifics, knowing that eventually reality will come swing your way.  Eg. the Enlightenment theory behind liberty and democracy#6 seems to be the ideal, but it requires some cognitive dissonance, namely the ability to say \\\"I disagree with what you''re doing, but will defend your right to do it.\\\"  Most people are not capable of this kind of cognitive dissonance - either they slip into \\\"I will not defend your right to do this\\\" and end up with #1 or #2, or they slip into \\\"I agree with what you''re doing\\\" and end up with #5.So #5 is the most stable system that a large civilization can enter.  Most Western democracies actually function as a combination of #5 and #6, with the masses adjusting their beliefs to fit their leaders and the leaders themselves agreeing to disagree under fundamental principles.  U.S. democracy is currently in danger because a disturbing number of \\\"leaders\\\" (on both sides) are suggesting #1 or #3, but the political party system is meant to encourage #6.Incidentally, the same problem happens with multi-party governments.

It has to do with more with how the US government is set up and less with the psychology of its people.  There are other countries with different setups that are not two-party dominant.  One viable way out of such dominance is some form of party-list proportional representation (see http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Party-list_proportional_represe...) .The second is all about psychology, it most certainly has several components at play.

They go with perhaps the simplest method to decide, which is listen to what the group told me before.  There is some real trade-off here.  To be fully informed is perhaps impossible.

I think I''ll manage to piss off both the Austrian school mises.org Libertarians and the I-always-get-screwed-by-corporations Liberals.Free markets work when they transmit information with each transaction.  When a factory owner raises his prices to cover rising costs, he''s encapsulating information about everything that''s happened further up the value chain.  When a shopkeeper lowers the price he''s willing to pay, he''s encapsulating information about consumer demand and everything downstream in the value chain.  If a new means of production becomes available that''s more efficient than the old one, there''s a profit opportunity available for the aspiring entrepreneur.  And everybody has an incentive to pass on correct information, because otherwise it''s their own bank account that will suffer.  This appears to be the only way to organize an economy efficiently.Free markets fail when transactions conceal information.  For example, many subprime loans were made to people who had no conceivable way of paying them off, but mortgage brokers had every incentive to hide that information from the hedge funds who bought them, and didn''t have to shoulder the risk of default themselves.  Health-care patients have no way of knowing whether a particular procedure is medically necessary and no incentive to find out, because the insurance company pays for it.  Microsoft customers had no way of knowing whether Windows is the best OS, because there were no alternatives (well, except Apple and Linux...pretend this is 1997 or so).There''s also the issue of transaction costs - it costs nearly as much money to collect tolls as it does to just build the damn highway, so the \\\"information\\\" that the customer sees is heavily distorted by the process of having to collect that information.So, based on this, I can derive some general principles for the role of government:1.) It should provide the institutional framework necessary for the market to function at all, eg. contract laws and defense.2.) It should rectify the \\\"lemon problem\\\", where sellers conceal vital information from buyers or vice-versa, eg. consumer protection laws, implied warranties, truth-in-advertising laws, full disclosure on mortgages, SEC regulation, etc.3.) It should prevent companies from leveraging a monopoly to enter a market.4.) It should rectify externalities, where a firm takes something of value to others but doesn''t pay for it, usually because it''s too difficult to arrange a transaction.  The classic example is pollution.5.) It should provide goods and services where the transaction cost of attempting to measure and restrict usage is greater than the actual value of the service.  Markets will never develop in these areas otherwise.  A good example would be roads.Some concrete examples, which''ll probably seem kinda out-there:To start, I wouldn''t have any taxes at all.  Instead, the government owns all land, and raises revenue by auctioning off leases on land, natural resources, and pollution credits.  These leases would be tradable, subdividable securities, and would be subject to normal SEC prohibitions on disclosure and insider trading.  If you wanted to construct a skyscraper that you expect to last 50 years, you''d buy a 50-year lease on the land.  If you ended up selling it after 20, you could sell the lease on the open market, but the land itself would revert back to the government after another 30 years.  The government can also buy the lease back by paying market rates.This helps the externality problem, because every time the voters want to prevent something like a polluting factory, they have the legal ability to, but they also have a precise dollar figure for how much it''ll cost, in economic terms.  If people don''t want oil companies to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they can simply block the lease on drilling rights, but it will cost them a few billion dollars.  Then they can decide whether the economic value to oil companies is worth more than the government services they will receive from it.As for spending itself - roads are an obvious one, because the transaction costs of tolls are hellish.  Defense is another one - I don''t think we need to spend quite so much as we do, but we do need a strong military.I would not provide free education, other than the basic literacy and civic requirements necessary for democracy to function.  You tend to get what you pay for.  Free education not only leads to bureacratic, uncaring schoolboards, but it also leads to freeriding, uncaring schoolchildren.  Instead, I''d create rigorous public evaluations of all schools - not necessarily tests (which generally reflect the politicians'' biases more than actually useful information), but statistics about where graduates end up, satisfaction levels, evaluations from past students, etc.  Then let people choose - and spend their own money - on schools.  Since people shouldn''t be denied education based on what their parents do, there should be loans available - but through the private sector, not public.  Also, education has a problem in that it takes years for it to pay off, and market conditions can change dramatically between when you enter and when you exit.  To insure against this, I''d create a tradable derivative called \\\"salary futures\\\" (again through the private sector).  This is not insurance on your salary (that would have a huge moral hazard problem), but rather a promise to pay the change in the difference between the average salaries of two professions.  These can be bundled into funds if necessary, to diversify across the whole economy.  So if you want to become an engineer but find that salaries have gone way down by the time you graduate, your salary future will kick in with the difference for X number of years, and then you can decide whether to stick with it or retrain as a lawyer.Health care is tricky because nobody wants to die, and if life really is priceless, then people should be willing to pay infinite amounts of money to avoid dying.  Markets aren''t meant to deal with infinities. I''d need to think about this; I suppose if I actually came up with a workable solution I''d be rich and famous and wouldn''t be posting it on a glorified message board. ;-)', 0);\n",

There have been free schools in America since before there was a country called \\\"America.\\\")Second of all, an economically free society would likely have taxes nowhere near 25%. That''s higher than Hong Kong''s income tax today, and much higher than America''s income tax when income tax was legalized.I''ve decided that the bare minimum of government that must be had are the courts (and the power to enforce their rulings). A libertarian society will be highly dependent on contracts; society could not function if you knew a powerful client could refuse to pay and ignore court rulings. I have trouble visualizing a fair, for-profit court system. If competing court systems exist, then how is the court system for a case chosen? Presumably, it would be spelled out in the contract, which gives a perpetual advantage to the vendor. Of course, the buyer could ignore the summons, but said court could force him to arrive and would then rule that it was justified doing so (as it was).Everything that is not a court can belong to the free market, but that does not mean should. For example, you could purchase the privilege to drive on one company''s network of roads, but, barring some major advances in scanning technology and some means of stopping trespassers,  the need to enforce that only paid cars use the road would be extraordinarily cumbersome. The best private road system I could see would be to have a monopoly on roads in every region; road companies could then make deals with neighbors for interregional traffic and coerce developments into requiring residents to pay the road company, at the risk of having the road company block access to the development. However, I''m not sure I can trust a private monopoly more than a government monopoly.Law enforcement is also a good candidate for government control; however, private police forces are not out of the question. There would probably be less overhead to hire police to protect an area rather than individuals, so police might not necessarily turn a blind eye to a homeless man getting mugged (not to mention that said criminal should be caught for the same reason Animal Control kills animals becoming accustomed to attacking humans). However, a system where every five feet is patrolled by a police force with different opinions of what an arrestable offense is is hardly ideal.Fire protection, another commonly cited candidate for government control, could actually work pretty well privately. A computer can easily check whether a certain building is protected, and the benefits of competition will result. However, one problem is that a fire on an unprotected building endangers adjacent buildings.', 2);\n",

My real problem with the talk is that isn''t testable - it makes an observation, then goes back into the facts to justify it.  I''m not seeing enough of the hypothesis-testing approach that is the cornerstone of real science.I don''t want to seem like I''m being too hard on the guy.  After all, some questions just can''t be approached this way.  We can measure the effectiveness of a new drug on blood pressure through hypothesis and testing, but it would be very difficult, maybe impossible, to use this approach to determine why the first world war was fought.  Sometimes you just have to go back through the facts and construct a plausable case.  But it isn''t science anymore.Aside from that, I agree (for what it''s worth) with much of what he has to say, but I still think he has understated the degree of exclusion women have experienced from male networks.  It''s really damaging.Suppose that it''s true, as the author stated, that men are more likely than women to be wired for risk.  Sounds reasonable enough.  But that might still mean that for every 5 people with the ability and inclination do do something risky (say, found a startup), 4 are male and one is female.  But the way males form networks often excludes the women - even in the modern day.  I don''t think it''s on purpose, and there''s rarely any malice, but it''s just as damaging.  You generally pick friends for your startup.  The people you get drunk with, stay up all night completing the compiler class with, cram into a hotel room in vegas with... and you tend to do these things with close friends who are almost always other guys.  If 4\\/5 are guys, then the odds that a man will find like-minded buddies is much higher than it is for women.  I double majored in Math and English.  It was a trip.  I''d count the ratio of men to women in each class, and it was usuall between 5:1 and 10:1.  And in the math class (sorry to say it), many of the women were planning on becoming math teachers.  This means that the women with the ability and inclination to do startups have to break into the boys club or they''ll be left in the cold.  So far, they''re usually left in the cold.  If this weren''t the case, I have no doubt we''d see far more women in fields that require a high degree of risk, creativity, and collaboration.     \\n', 0);\n",

As long as a founder is in charge, the CEO is working with the corporate culture.  When an outside manager is brought in, he usually ends up working against corporate culture.In every company I''ve worked in, the culture was essentially a reflection of the founder''s personality.  If there are multiple founders, it reflects a weird amalgam of all the ones that are involved in the daily business.  If an early employee tends to run things in the early days, the culture reflects them as much as the founders.  Think Intel and Andy Grove, or 3M and William McKnight.Companies tend to inherit both the best qualities and worst faults of their founders.  However, their position in the marketplace usually reflects the best qualities.  After all, nobody buys from a company for what it sucks at.An outsider brings his own strengths and weaknesses to the company, but it''s very unlikely that his strengths will line up with the culture and market that the company already has.  Think John Sculley and Apple - great executive for cola, not so great for computers.  The founder, instead, may have tons of liabilities, but at least he won''t be fighting the corporate culture he himself has created.There''s some evidence to back this up, for instance:1.) It echoes the findings in Good to Great: the turnaround process involves applying the \\\"hedgehog principle\\\" of asking yourself what the company is really passionate about, then getting the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus, and only then changing strategy.  The hedgehog principle is essentially a question about culture: where does the culture of this organization fit into the overall economy.  Then getting the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus consists of strengthening the positive aspects of the company culture and weakening the negative ones.2.) In cases where an outside turnaround CEO has successfully turned around a company, they usually spend a significant amount of time acclimatizing themselves to the existing culture, and only start changing things after they already \\\"fit in\\\".  Think Lou Gerstner and IBM.  Even then, they often make decisions that mortgage the long-term health of the company by destroying the previous cultural VALUES (986, 198, .  Gerstner eliminated IBM''s status as an R&#38;D powerhouse, for example, while James McNerney nearly destroyed 3M''s innovation culture with Six Sigma.3.)

Of course, because no successor has as large a stake in it as the original founder.

You would stand a much better chance of attracting the best people if they were going to get the billions when you stepped down -- subject to vesting and performance.

The terms sheet would be essentially a non-binding high-level agreement to the basic terms of the deal.  Price is just one of many terms.  It is clearly one of the important ones, but there are other sometimes equally important terms in a given deal, such as associated non-compete and consulting contracts.  Also, \\\"price\\\" is a nebulous term and is usually not just one isolated number.  For instance, there can be earn-outs, hold-backs, escrowed amounts, consulting fees, etc., and all of these can be tied to indemnities, conditions, etc.  And the structure of the deal, e.g. stock vs asset, impacts the net take home to the shareholders, which is what most people are ultimately interested in.Both parties agree on the terms sheet through negotiation.  That sounds obvious, but the point is there is not one set process.  There are many strategies to negotiation and some make more sense than others in the context of a particular deal.  It is not uncommon for parties to walk away and come back to the table at this stage, and in fact, at all stages.  The \\\"price\\\" could easily move up or down significantly depending on a number of factors.  It really comes down to what the seller is willing to sell for and what the buyer is willing to buy for.  If there is an overlap, there could be a deal.  If not, then no deal.

Ray''s music with the band is nice, but the style definitely was markedly different from what most people think of as \\\"Genesis.\\\"  The same thing happened earlier in the band''s history too, when Peter Gabriel left and Phil Collins replaced him as the front-man.  Everything changed: the song writing, the style of play, everything.  It took half a decade for people to get used to it.Writing software is kind of the same way.  Just look at the impossible made possible by demo coders on old-school 8-bit computers.  These programs would never have been successfully coded in a commercial organization.  But, -bands- of coders wrote them successfully.  They promoted their software as bands, included self-written music, artwork, etc.It would be interesting to see how a band-style organization would apply towards more practical software products.  Software so produced would come in boxes with the band''s logo, but more importantly, a _list of credits_, anecdotes about the software''s creation, etc.  That is, to make the delivery of the software more _human_.Back in the day, when credits on software were more commonplace, it was possible to judge the quality of a product (to some extent) based on who was involved with it.  Some people became reknowned coders, reknowned technical writers, etc.  I think it gave two incentives: first, your name is going on the box of that package -- this gave prestige in the community post-sale; second, it allowed the customers to predict the overall feel of the software prior to actually purchasing it, based on their experiences with software written by the same or similar authors.Literature is another example.

If the answer is \\\"no\\\", then forget it... don''t learn how to program. Instead, find a programmer who likes your ideas and is willing to implement them for you, as an equal partner. This may be tough to find, but that''s what you have to do. Ideas have tons of value. In my opinion, ideas are insanely important. The best-engineered, slickest, cutting-edge application isn''t going to make a flipping cent unless the user-facing features add value. And these features can be formed from ideas that ANYONE has - not just programmers. Don''t think that you have to be a programmer to have great ideas; that''s utter bullshit. That being said, I think you do need to know your way around technology, because as a lot of people say you need to know the options; what is feasible, what is not feasible; what powers and raw functionalities you have at your disposal. Read Wikipedia articles about things like AJAX, server-side computing, search algorithms, social computing, etc. Watch Google Tech Talks about whatever sounds cool to you. Try to figure out what the current state of technology is - in terms of functionality and capabilities - across the CS\\/software board. You don''t need to be a programmer to do this. But don''t struggle through concepts that you find boring; read about stuff that seems cool and interesting. The bottom line is, do what you love, period. Yeah it''s cliche. But if you take up an activity because you care about the end result, and not about the journey, you''re going to end up frustrated and will probably just give up. Whatever you''re passionate about, do just that, and find someone else who''s passionate about the rest to work with you.But you should give programming an honest shot anyway, to find out if you like it.

For IBM.- YC encourages people (not just kids) to build things.  For the people building them.- EB teams must have \\\"business\\\" and \\\"technical\\\" people, selected by a random manager at IBM.- YC teams are self-selected, and are judged by what they produce, not what label they use to describe their abilities.- EB teams build something that may, or may not, ever see the light of day in the market.- YC teams build something that, if they work hard, can hit the market whenever they''re ready.  No manager ever has to sign off on the project.In short, EB is a corporate internship and YC is an opportunity to build something great (you don''t need YC to build something great, but for many folks it can help).  Corporate internships are fine, and I''m sure everyone has a great time and IBM gets its pick of some great talent discovered through the process, but it is just a corporate inernship.

This means that writing music is less exacting, but can also be more subtle.  The other big difference is that you aren''t usually writing music to solve an external problem.  With music, you have to invent the problems you want to solve.  You might say \\\"I want to hold an F# in the alto line for 4 measures, while moving all the other voices in a chord progression that adheres to the following restrictions...\\\"  You just make up the conditions on your own.

You have to train physically in order to be good, and learning bad habits is disastrous.

This seems a somewhat weak ending given the rest of the article, however reasonable this conclusion may be.  Furthermore, to quote myself:\\n\\\"...one of my favorite anecdotes from Blink is the tale of the identical ice cream: the same ice cream was wrapped in two different packages, one plain, the other fancy, and taken around to the public for taste tests. People actually reported that the ice cream in the ''fancier'' package _tasted_ better. What''s great about this story is that it''s an excellent way to explain to someone the value of beauty to usability. Given two functionally identical products, users will believe that one is _easier to use_ simply by virtue of it being aesthetically pleasing. I once saw a presentation at a UPA (Usability Professionals Assoc) Conference where a study showed just that - a product with identical information architecture was run through two usability tests: one where the product had a rudimentary look and feel, and one where the look and feel had been touched up by a graphic designer. User data showed that people felt the prettier version was easier for them to use, even though it took them the same time to complete tasks in both versions. Now, as an interaction designer myself, I would hope this argument is never used to dismiss the importance of interaction design and information architecture. We can''t use aesthetics to ''put lipstick on the pig,'' as one of my coworkers is fond of saying. But if you''ve taken the time to make a really usable product which meets a user need, imagine how much people will love it if you ALSO make it beautiful. That, for me, is the definition of a \\\"delightful experience.\\\" \\\" (http:\\/\\/news.ycombinator.com\\/item?id=38839)', 4);\n",

Yes, there is a correlation between higher education and higher salaries -- no, this does not imply causation!There are many confounding factors:  People who are more intelligent, have parent(s) who pursued higher education, have parents with higher income, or are white are both more likely to receive a bachelor''s degree AND on average earn more than other people with the same amount of education.  (In the past, being male was a predictor for both higher education and higher earnings, but this is not a significant factor for people born after 1980.)In addition, the statistic ignores the fact that pursuing higher education shortens one''s career -- people who spend 4-5 years in college on average work for 2-3 years less than those who started their careers immediately after high school.  As a result, comparing \\\"40-year careers\\\" is bogus -- the only reasonable comparison is between the total careers of individuals, including the time when one person is at college while the other is working.Finally, even if the statistic were computed correctly and reflected causation, it would be misleading: Different careers are not influenced equally by education.  Generally speaking, people don''t finish their education before they start thinking about what career the will pursue; someone who was planning on becoming a plumber isn''t likely to suddenly decide that he wants to become a brain surgeon just because he finds that he has a bachelor''s degree.Decide what you want to do (either as a single career, or more likely thinking of a number of careers which seem interesting), and look at what qualifications are needed for those.

It is the best system for a typical wiki hosted on your server, if you like to extend and customize the system, and you happen to like Python.A wiki page can use any markup supported by the system parsers. MoinMoin comes with its own markup, rst, plain text and docbook parsers. Parsers for other markups created by the community are in http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/ParserMarket. You add your own parser that know how to parse the text and how to drive the formatter, which create the html. Parsers are also used for syntax highlighting. Moin comes with cplusplus, CSV, irc, java, pascal and python. Formatter can create any output you like - the default create html, and the system provides other formatters for xml, docbook and plain text. You can add your own formatter if needed. Any page can be formatted in any exiting format, for example http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/?action=format&#38;mimetype=t....To create custom applications, you usually add both action and macro plugins. Macro is a plugin that execute when a page is rendered and return output. Action is a plugin that handle request to urls like \\/wiki\\/pagename?action=foo. Most of MoinMoin UI is implemented in terms of actions and marcos, so for example, if you want to have a different RecentChanges - you can simply install a modified RecentChanges macro in your wiki. You can find lot of actions and macros in http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/ActionMarket and http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/MacroMarket.Formatted pages are compiled to Python bytecode, and literally executed when a page is visited. Static macros run when a page is compiled, and their output is compiled into the page. Dynamic macro are executed during page runtime, and are used to provide user, time or namespace dependent data.MoinMoin let you have acl for entire wiki, evaluated before and after page acl. You can have a default acl applied to pages without acl, or page specific acl. See http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/HelpOnAccessControlLists. For greater control, you can use your own security policy object, implementing any security scheme you like. See http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/SecurityPolicy.MoinMoin UI can be changed by a theme plugin. A theme is responsible for creating the stuff before an after a page or action content. You can provide multiple themes for single wiki, or your own customized theme. MoinMoin uses plain Python as \\\"template\\\" language - you can easily change the behavior by overriding few methods. See http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/HelpOnThemes. There are many themes created by the community in http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/ThemeMarket.MoinMoin support Wiki-RPC 1 and 2 http:\\/\\/www.jspwiki.org\\/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiRPCInterface2. You can also add xmlrpc plugin to extend the system as you like.MoinMoin can be deployed on any platform, either using plain CGI (slow), standalone or twisted Python server (e.g. behind Apache), or using  FastCGI (recommended) or mod_python (more tricky).There is a GUI editor - modified FCKEditor, which may be easier for common users, but it has issues.Search is very powerful, supporting Google style modifiers, booleans and regular expressions. However, search become slow on big wikis. For typical wiki it is just fine. For bigger wikis it is painfully slow. See http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/HelpOnSearching. There is an experimental index search engine using Lupy. The next version will have a better search using http:\\/\\/www.xapian.org\\/.MoinMoin has great Unicode support - anything can be unicode: page content, page names, group names, user names and even passwords. User names can also contain spaces, so users can register with their real name.MoinMoin has the best Right to Left support. You can define a language and direction for whole wiki, single page, sections within a page, or words within a paragraph.

So there''s a balance that needs to be reached, and the discussion can be emotional.

I can send you a sample agreement to illuminate the trade-offs. waytking AT gmail DOT com.(2a) If all founders can''t agree on the founder equity vesting balance, you do not have a startup team. Form another one. (2b) If all founders agree on founder equity vesting balance, your lawyer can easily form your Delaware C-corp for a few hundred bucks. If you want ultimate flexibility, he can form a Delaware LLC and create your LLC operating agreement for around a thousand bucks. But a C-corp should be fine. Pay in cash - don''t pay in equity.

We had to do three applicants every ten minutes, which works out to just over three minutes per app. In that amount of time you can quickly scan over the grades and SATs, and maybe read the first paragraph of each essay if you''re lucky. The other thing I learned is that the real admissions officers got statistics updates twice a day for the average GPA and SAT score, and also the projected US News rank. This means that whether or not your grades and SATs were good enough depended largely on whether your app was read before or after lunch, because what it took to get into the college completely changed every time they were handed the new report.For low income minority students there was an option to set the app aside for a second reading in order to learn more about the student''s situation and if there were an ameliorating factors, but for the rest of the students the admissions officers were expected to make a decision on the first pass after the three minutes. Athletes also largely got pre-approved by the academic department they were applying for, so they pretty much knew whether they''d be accepted before they ever applied. The flip side is that they only got an edge in admissions if they applied early decision, because if they were going to bring down the average GPA then they had to bring up the average matriculation in order to not affect the overall US News rank.I think it''s one of those things like eVoting. That is, people with no CS experience think eVoting is totally secure whereas CS experts know it isn''t. Similarly, I highly suspect that anyone who thinks getting admitted to an Ivy shows a certain baseline level of respectability has never worked in admissions. I''d guarantee it.As for the importance of college GPA, if you want to see something funny then apply for a wall street job. If they ask you what your GPA was in college, ask them how GPA correlates with alpha. :-)The craziest thing was that Google did a massive HR survey and determined that there was basically zero correlation between college GPA and value created for the company. Because of this they decided that they would give jobs to five or six people with sub 3.0 GPAs each year. Well if there is little or no correlation, why should it matter what GPA is at all?

But most were significantly lacking in at least one necessary area to be labeled \\\"smart\\\" IMO (often several), including intuitiveness, creativity, being a self-starter, analytical thinking, breadth and depth of knowledge, intellectual curiosity, etc.Putting exact numbers on it is difficult due to the self-segregation at MIT and subjectivity obviously at play.  However, I would say perhaps 30% fall into the seriously lacking category, another 30% in a substantially lacking category and another 25% in a good but not great category (perhaps lacking only one major thing).  That leaves only 15% or so of people I came across I would say were \\\"smart\\\" in the sense described above.  When you move to people with the essential qualities necessary to work successfully at a really early stage startup, I would say it drops to 7% or so.   I''m not saying found one, just work at one as one of the first employees.  When you move to people with all the founding qualities, the % probably drops to 1-2%.  I know this first hand after trying to start companies with people in the \\\"smart\\\" category.The above has really hit home other times as well.   Here are two more occasions.  First, when graduating, 62 people in my class out of about 1,080 (~6%) were inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.  I was shocked at a) how many of these people were my friends at MIT; b) how many of these people I had come across (given that I didn''t meet all 1,080; and c) that this list included pretty much all of the people I had previously labeled \\\"smart\\\" myself in my class that I had come across.  Second, my wife taught statistics at MIT for several years.  One time a kid came up to her complaining about an exam grade and told her it was not possible to have gotten an A on this exam.  He said all his friends studied real hard and yet they all ended up with Cs and Ds.  To which she replied, actually roughly 30% of the class got As.  The point is, they were completely self-segregated by \\\"smartness\\\" and didn''t even really know it.All that being said, an MIT degree really does go a long way in terms of impressing the average person\\/company.  I have done independent consulting and applied for jobs where they basically stopped researching me when they saw MIT.  That is the rule, not the exception.  And that was in Boston.

There are two arguments happening here. The first is that entrepreneurship and business success are not so well correlated with where you go to undergrad. The second is that where you go to college doesn''t make much of a difference in life in general. I won''t really quarrel with the first, since it''s been demonstrated pretty often, and YC''s results support it as well. The second, on the other hand...The main problem with trying to assert that college doesn''t make a difference in life is that there''s really no easy measurement you can do over \\\"net change\\\" in life. That''s due both to the long span of time a life consumes as well as the complex and\\/or fuzzy cause-effect relationships that are at play throughout. At best, I think, you would need to argue over objective differences that have some immediate effect, and then hope that those actually do make a difference. As an example, here are some of the things that I think made Paul Graham successful that are pretty strongly related to his going to graduate school at Harvard: - he met RTM and Trevor there- he got to spend his time in Boston, where he''s acknowledged startups can thrive- being able to drop the H-bomb almost certainly helped give credibility to his company- he learned Lisp (not really the most popular language at the time, except at certain places)Would Viaweb have happened had he gone elsewhere, or skipped grad school altogether?

CMU and Berkeley were both very rigorous; the difference was that CMU was rigorous in a somewhat more pointless, soul-sucking manner, on average, and didn''t explain things as well. Stanford was somewhat less rigorous, which I imagine was because of the Ivy-league difficult-to-get-in but easy-to-pass phenomenon. This seems to correlate somewhat with the number of undergrads at each place involved in research; at both CMU and Berkeley, I know many undergrads involved in research, while the one professor I talk to at Stanford hungrily scrounges for the rare undergrad who''s good at research.

Obviously an accountant is expensive overkill for payroll and bookkeeping, and the accountants I have known outsource it.  Administaff doesn''t seem to like very small companies (or at least they charge as though they don''t like them).  The online services I''ve used for payroll have ended up with me doing most of the hard work by hand (they''re glorified calculators with all the percentages already punched in, but they don''t handle actually paying people or getting the taxes paid).And, of course, no one should ever be without health insurance for any period of time.  It''s just too much risk.  But I haven''t found health insurance to be the hardest part to deal with: just call up Unicare.

Group health insurance is much more expensive than individual plans for young healthy people (most of what YC funds).  I looked into it and group insurance for me would cost about $280\\/month, vs. the $84 I''m paying now.

Yes, I am a co-founder of a new Web 2.0 startup and do have the Hacker News RSS feed on my homepage. Airing our dirty laundry in a public forum wasn''t my decision, but. . .I feel like I have to defend myself a bit about all of the negative comments. We are clearly in the product development stage and I''m not a developer, so my efforts are focused on enabling #1 to spend 100% of his time on product development. I have 2 years VC experience and 3 years LBO experience (where I am now), so I do all the legal agreements (options, LLC filings, prop rights agreements, Trademark filings, contribution\\/consulting agreements, etc.) and I''m the one that negotiates and drafts terms for all of our other developers (they tend to come and go due to the lack of cash to pay). I file taxes, pay the bills, and track financials to report to investors on a quarterly basis.  I prepare executive summaries to send to prospective investors and submit to conferences. I am the one that plays \\\"bad cop\\\" with the developers when things aren''t going well or they are underferforming so #1 can maintain a good working relationship. I help with design, layout, and other ideas related to the site, mainly with UI, new features, and catching bugs\\/fixes. I interact often with our Alpha users to stay in touch with what they need and what they want. Soon I will start helping with writing tests since I asked #1 what I could do to help more directly with Beta short of learning Ruby. Some of the toughest decisions that we face having so much to do with so few resources to do it with is WHAT to work on, and I try to have open conversations with the team to make sure we''re prioritizing everything right and agree as a group, because startups tend to start to ramble along unless we discuss what we absolutely need to get out the door every week. So, I wouldn''t say that I don''t do anything, but rather I don''t do anything to ease the bottleneck, which is currently product development. #1 and I came up with the idea on a phone call a while back and it has become what it is today, so I truly am an original co-founder. It''s also important to note that #1 and I started another internet company in college which worked out well considering it was a one semester project. We are also best friends.I just got married 2 weeks ago and have a job that I can''t just bounce back into ever again. My entire family is in the Midwest and there are few good PE shops there. Getting a job in PE is really hard. I believe one in 50 Harvard MBAs can get one, and I was fortunate enought to get one at a good firm in the midwest near my family. So quitting my job is not something I take lightly, but I am open to it. #1 was previously an independent consultant that can easily get a job as good or better within months. He is a tremendously talented developer and I''m proud to call him my co-founder. When you say \\\"risk\\\", I''m not sure you can compare one man''s risk of quitting with anothers. Different industry, different pay, different location, different circumstances.  #1 and I had the discussion of what it would take for me to quit on day 1.  I said a significant capital raise (I tossed out $500k-$1mm+) or a really strong user ramp. I spend nearly all my free time (I work a LOT, so there''s not much) on this startup.  For me to dedictate my only 2 free hours a day to this is a lot, especially considering my recent marriage, but I do it anyway. I would not call this a lack of dedication at all. I''ve taken 1 C++ class in my life, so convincing me to quit my job to learn to code is a bit far-fetched. We know what we need, we just need the developers to create it, but using me as a developer does not seem like the right decision.I really don''t think the issue here is that I suck, I think it''s that I''m not a developer. Things took longer than expected to get off the ground as far as product developement and #1 is getting antsy, and understandably so. We''ve gone through several equity-only developers that, in the end, may have taken up more of #1''s time then they were worth. I''ve tried getting in touch with the Universities CS departments where #1 lives to try to get some local candidates to get a better startup culture\\/environment going since I''m in a different location than #1, but there aren''t many resumes that come across with Ruby experience. If I''m in the way of making this a success, I''m willing to do what it takes to remove me as an obstacle. I guess (no offense) I''m just not convinced that YC and $15,000 is what it takes to make this a success. I think another full-time talented developer that can work with #1 in the same city would do wonders, and I''m willing to cough up the equity. Now that everyone knows the full story, I''d be interested to hear some feedback. Maybe the feedback is still that I suck, but at least you have my side of the story. If everyone thinks YC is critical to where we are going and if PG would admit #1 if I stepped down and re-worked the equity I would be willing to do that. The important part is that I''m a fair, honest, and flexible guy and just want this to be a success. I understand my lack of development is not really helping us right now, but my \\\"non-production\\\" contributions should not be overlooked either.I apologize for airing our dirty laundry here, but I felt I had to respond once it was up.- #2', 0);\n",

I can''t for the life of me remember the historian''s name, but his theory seemed to have some merit.His basic argument was that there was a fundamental difference in diets between the two cultures. China was primarily a rice-growing culture, which meant that they needed a large amount of space and irrigation to create paddy fields. Once the rice was grown, it was simple to harvest and the only further treatment it needed to be rendered edible was boiling. All in all, the Chinese culture had quite a low-tech solution to the problem of feeding large amounts of people.On the other hand, rice was not native to Western Europe and impossible to cultivate there anyway. In order to feed its population, European culture grew grains such as wheat, oats and barley, which were not only far harder to harvest but required grinding \\/ milling and baking into bread before they could be rendered edible. Compared to the Chinese rice-based solution, the Western Europe model required a lot more technology. There was, therefore, a much higher demand for technological, engineered solutions to the problem of providing mass sustenance. In turn, this demand led to the adoption of such advances as horse collars, mills, ploughs, crop rotation and horseshoes. All these things were expensive and often required collective solutions.The historian''s main hypothesis was that the effect of this continual (and necessary) improvement of farming techniques was to engender a culture of engineering in Western Europe. Regardless of where the innovations came from (and they were often cribbed from other cultures, often Middle Eastern) the continual and expensive process of re-engineering farming practices led directly to the development of engineering as a discipline.I really wish I could remember the guy''s name.', 3);\n",

(The software helps find design flaws, does cohort analysis, helps summarize results, etc.)   During that experience, I became very interested in nutrition research as a hobby.  I basically learned that things I grew up eating were unbelievably bad for me.  (I grew up drinking milk, eating meals centered around meat, with lots of refined, fried and sugary ingredients.  Good old Southern cooking and Standard American Diet.)  I also learned that much of what we are taught (\\\"Milk for strong bones\\\") is complete bullshit when you actually read the studies.  Milk is really for osteoporosis and breast cancer.We sold that company, and I stopped seriously reading on the subject.  Recently, illnesses in my family (cancer and autoimmune diseases) have caused me to get into the subject again to an even greater degree.  I''ve also experimented with my own diet for the last several years and I''ve arrived at a very different conclusion than this fellow.There are tons of people that have an almost religious agenda about pushing specific diets.  They are usually well-intentioned...they just really want to believe they are right.  They publish pseudo-scientific articles like this one that have just enough logic in them to seduce people into believing them.  The media is also horrible about publishing sensational (but poorly analyzed) nutrition research.  They flip-flop their headlines so much (\\\"Coffee Can Cure X\\\", then \\\"Coffee Causes X Cancer\\\") that people finally just give up on trying to understand nutrition and they just continue eating the crap that they have always eaten.  Which is amazingly sad, because proper nutrition is really the best medicine on earth.I LOOOOOOOVE steak and ice cream, but a vegetarian\\/vegan diet has been shown in almost every study to be a more healthful diet in every respect.  And the studies that fail to show that are usually flawed and\\/or underwritten by industry trade groups.  There is no \\\"perfect diet\\\" for everyone...there will always be corner cases.  Some people with specific genetic predispositions SHOULD avoid grains altogether.  Apart from gluten sensitivity, there is the issue of molecular mimicry and genetic autoimmune issues, etc. Modern people are dying of heart disease, cancer and strokes, though.  Those illnesses are linked to higher consumption of meat (Paleo-coronary, anyone?), dairy, sugar, cooking oil, and refined foods.  We are NOT dying of starvation, hypothermia, or tooth loss - which were probably some of the more pressing concerns in the paleolithic era.  We are also living 2-4 times longer than our ancestors, on average, so we have entirely different concerns.This is really a fascinating area of research...I''ve noticed that tons of computer hackers are also very interested in nutrition and body\\/diet hacks.

Plus there is a high probability that I will have to customize the db interaction so much that it may defeat the purpose in the first place.So I''m leaning towards writing my own PHP+MySQL code from scratch, but I''m all alone so writing it wouldn''t be something that seems accomplish-able in 3 months. Ruby on rails seems fast enough, but that web service thing seems like a real PAIN. I''m stuck between a rock and a hard place.Anyway, Thanks for everyones feedback!\\n', 1);\n",

I also think that evolution is much more beautiful than anything I''ve seen in Maths so far.I found it interesting, because it''s the first time I internalized that ambiguity prevents long chains of arguments, because fuzziness is multiplicative (so to say). As a corollary, if social behavior was not ambiguous, sociology would be potentially just as deep as physics. The quote actually has very little to do with the rest of the book. It was merely a prelude to their discussion on the evolution of societies, which is one of the Major Transitions.The last remark is cool too, \\\"it may be that no operative theories are possible in the social sciences\\\", because it applies to biology as well. We do have some operative theories on evolution, but there''s absolutely no guarantee that every phenomena has a simple holistic explanation.

So current soft sciences plod about trying to gather some type of predictablity in their theories, but often falling back to trying to make causal statements of their experimental observations.I think there''s been attempts before, like cybernetics, that tries to model human behavior using signal processing techniques.  To my understanding, it''s since fallen out of favor.  So while it''s been tried before--and I don''t know for sure, but my gut says that there probably is mathematics, other than statistics, to bring more analysis into the social sciences.Otherwise, the math just hasn''t been invented yet.

It''s not like the desktop world where you are launching a year or two from now and can wait for the computers to catch up.  You are launching a month from now and it needs to be fast.  I would prefer to use a web mail client other than GMail, simply because I''m scared of my Google dependency.  But every other web email client I''ve used ( Yahoo, Joyent, inbox.com, Zimbra) feels much slower.  Google spends enormous effort optimizing their javascript load times and it really pays off.2)  Broadband speeds are not growing at Moore''s law.  Terrible regulatory law trumps technological gains.3)  It be hard for a company to lock everyone into its  javascript platform when the entire source code is downloadable.4)  The trouble with javascript is not cross browser incompatibility.  If you use a good library and have learned common gotchas you should not have to spend too much time debugging IE ( I probably spend less than 10% of my javascript coding time on cross browser issues).  The trouble with javascript is that there are still a number of things it just can''t do, and won''t be able to do until the browsers change.  For instance, there is no way to detect the exact pixel size of a character of text.  This makes it impossible to build a real word processor in javascript.  Nor can you detect a collision between the opaque regions of two png images (this is needed for most simple 2-d games).  Well ... it''s almost impossible to do these things.  I suppose you could define your own image and font formats completely in javascript, and render the entire screen using 1 pixel divs.  But that''s just crazy talk.  It would be a huge library - maybe 250 MB - and would be very slow until computers got faster.  And it would require eating at least 6000 packages of ramen to build the thing.

I was pretty excited. I thought we were going to save the world. But, I found the group was full of completely helpless people who have, after 2 years, yet to engineer anything. So, I found a project and recruited a team from outside the organization. We set out to design a composting toilet that could work in cold climates. It was pretty frustrating, because no matter how perfect the design was it would require expensive foreign components (like solar panels or small wind turbines) and the solution only prevents the spread of disease when implemented on a large scale. Eventually, I developed an alternative that can be built entirely from local materials. We are finishing the design and hope to built a prototype this December in Peru. This design looks promising and if implemented on a large scale will reduce the spread of waste borne disease like cholera and dysentery. These diseases primarily kill children, long before they have to worry about cancer or aids.

Until you have done that, I do not believe that you would do anything useful with the money, if it were to be handed to you.Funding an intellectual to stare at his navel for 5 years is of not use to anyone (and is barely of any use to the intellectual, who - if he is honest with himself - will look back on the 5 years as wasted, and without result).Funding an intellectual to work on something that sounds useful, on the other hand, makes a lot of sense.Bottom line: stop focusing on yourself, and focus on the value that you''re going to create.  Once you do that, you''ll have a real plan that might be deserving of someone else''s hard earned dollars (after all,if you don''t want to work for The Man to earn the benjamins, why should someone else who has ALREADY worked for The Man give you his dough, which is to say, the crystalized value of his hours?)\\n', 1);\n",

The problem is camber: the side-to-side tilt of the wheel and tire. Bringing the top of the wheel closer to the center of the car is called \\\"negative camber\\\" while the opposite is \\\"positive camber\\\". Most modern cars have a little bit of negative camber, which increases as the suspension is compressed. The relationship of compression to camber is called the \\\"camber curve\\\".When the tire is being deformed by cornering forces, negative camber helps more of the tire stay in contact with the road. When traveling in a straight line, negative camber reduces the tire''s contact with the road and increases tire wear. The reduced contact is visible on the left rear tire in the fourth photo.One solution is to design a suspension with a very fast camber curve and allow minimal compression when cornering. This is similar to what most sports cars already do, and has a couple problems of its own. Such a suspension design is more limited in the distance the wheel can travel upward  and has somewhat less traction on bumpy surfaces.Another solution is to have a separate motor to adjust camber.

Often times this is because the schema we have in our heads is more broadly defined than the underlying phenomenon.A good example of this is the phenomenon of prodigies. We know there are some people in society who are exceptionally talented in certain areas, and we call these people prodigies. We then have certain schemas that we apply to these prodigies in our quest for wisdom.But even though prodigies clearly exist, our schemas often seem to not hold up so well. For example, studies have shown that child prodigies are often not significantly more successful than the rest of us when they grow up. And similarly, many prodigious adults were completely unremarkable as children. Why is this? How is it possible for such exceptional children not to make anything of themselves, and for such exceptional adults to have been completely average as children?Malcolm Gladwell observes that the reason for this is because when we describe child prodigies, we are describing people who are gifted at learning. Whereas when we describe adult prodigies, we are actually describing people are gifted at doing.Because we are applying one set of sensemaking tools to both groups, our schemas tend to not hold up so well even though they are based on an underlying truth. The solution to this is to create one set of schemas for understanding and dealing with child prodigies, and another set of schemas for understanding and dealing with adult prodigies. There are often areas where we engage in fuzzy thinking, and apply one toolset to multiple distinct phenomena. Philosophers and thinkers can create enormous value by identifying distinct phenomena, and giving suggestions for how to think about each one.PG actually does this in his essay How to Make Wealth. He observes that money and wealth are not the same thing so we should think about them differently. Specifically, that money is sort of an abstraction of wealth, but for various reasons we can benefit from thinking about wealth on a lower level. Providing the sort of disambiguation that this essay does is really valuable, which is why this is arguably the most useful of all the PG essays. It seems like with math we start with something we know is true but not necessarily useful (like just the concept of a line) and then we abstract our way to usefulness. This is opposed to philosophy, which generally takes the stance that all models are false but some models are useful. In philosophy we usually start with something that is useful in certain situations but not necessarily universally true, and then we disambiguate our way down toward truthfulness. I don''t really see a problem with philosophy as long as it is empirically useful under at least in certain conditions. I feel there are two major issues with philosophy today:1. No \\\"philosophical method\\\" the same way there is a scientific method, which means philosophy doesn''t really build on each other from one philosopher to the next.2. No real way to categorize ideas the same way you can categorize physics research, which makes it hard to find prior art. So even though Malcolm Gladwell and PG make really good arguments, there is no guarantee that people in the future will use these arguments.

People, such as Aristophanes, said the same things about Plato in his day that you say in your essay.  Yet, generations of great thinkers have chosen Plato over the Cynics and Epicureans, today''s relativists and materialists.  Your critique of the uselessness of philosophy is more indicative of the fact that many of the humanities in academia today are purposely biased towards relativism or materialism.While I agree that philosophy should be tested with practice, I don''t think practicality should restrict inquiry.  Otherwise, we become very short sighted.  Math is a great example of this, which you''ve pointed out in one of your essays.  Finally, you misunderstand Aristotle''s support for ''useless'' theory.

First I tried to get various working environments going like:Emacs + Slime + SBCLEmacs + Quack + PLT Scheme\\nI also tried DrScheme (which is a great learning environment).  Not knowing what i''d really need I also did some searching and discovered a few books:http:\\/\\/mitpress.mit.edu\\/sicp\\/http:\\/\\/www.ccs.neu.edu\\/home\\/dorai\\/t-y-scheme\\/t-y-scheme.htmlhttp:\\/\\/www.gigamonkeys.com\\/book\\/\\ni also purchased the little schemer.  I learned various interesting things from these different sources.1. practical common lisp was essentially useless to me since i''d already been kind of feeling sold on using scheme and had very little interest in common lisp.  what it DID teach me was how datastructures in lisp are created under the hood (or how one might go about implementing them).  from this perspective it was very nice and helpful when understading, car, cdr and mapcar.  although i wish i''d had a nice example of implementing  a scheme in C.2. reading The Little Schemer, has been the single most satisfying read of my entire computing life.  so much so\\nthat i bought The Seasoned Schemer and The Reasoned Schemer\\nwithout hesitation at price.  this book will teach you to \\\"think lisp\\\" if you can just make it through the first book you will honestly know everything you need to about the lisp mindset and be ready to actually write useful code and no be shocked or surprised by anything.  i can''t stress enough how useful this book is READ IT.3. Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum days has been a powerful reference for me and I honestly hope that it grows and evolves, it''s easy to reference and great for when you start actually hacking on projects.  It''s just simple and obvious.4. SICP is a mammoth work and also has a very nice video series.  If you''re serious about Lisp and even more serious about Scheme and furthermore serious about computing.  You must read this.  My approach so far has  been to read top down (ie. cover to cover) and also use it as a reference.  I get sheer joy from reading it, but it''s amazing how practical it can be as well.Personally I''ve settled on scheme, i dont'' really like common lisp i find it irritating and with projects like Chicken: http:\\/\\/www.call-with-current-continuation.org\\nout there I feel really comfortable.  I re-wrote my entire\\nblog using nothing but chicken and the web-scheme egg.  I recently wrote an irc bot for fun during a huge bot writing session that broke out in a channel i frequent (don''t ask we all just started writing bots for some reason).If you''re looking for good platforms the best I can recommend are:SBCL (hands down nothing really compares so far)PLT Scheme (aka DrScheme if you like GUI''s)Chicken (the absolute best imho BSD licensed scheme)\\nHope this helps everyone.

        "insert into Comments(id,post_id, content, rating) VALUES (1897, 380, 'First I''ll tell my story to answer the question, then I''ll put resources mentioned in a list at the end.  I''ve been picking up bits and pieces, and would not call myself anything near an expert.  I knew what Lisp was from a Languages class in college, and we actually used lisp to implement a language.  Roughly none of it stuck, except for car, cdr, and the idea of using prefix notation and the ''everything is an expression'' idea.  Relearning it started with just reading PG''s essays and getting curious.  Being too lazy to order it online, I looked in every bookstore and library I encountered for ANSI Common Lisp, but never found it.  It''s rather pricey, too, which is why I was hesitant.I started with SICP and the video lectures.  Something important came up in another part of my life, though, and I basically put Lisp on hold for several months.  When I finally got settled down again, I started playing with with emacs-lisp.  I knew emacs would be useful no matter what happened next.  I downloaded the manual (which is dense) and scrounged for tips on the internet.  The idea was that I''d get familiar thinking in that style and using it for practical things, before moving on to something more serious.  Emacs-lisp has some limitations (no closures, for example), so it wasn''t too long before I started looking elsewhere.My next two sources were On Lisp by Paul Graham and Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp by Peter Norvig.  Both books include speedy overviews of Lisp, and point you to Guy Steele''s Common Lisp The Language (2nd ed) (CTL2), which can be found online, for authoritative reference.  Both books are good because they are exciting and fun.  Norvig has a fairly gentle introduction, while Graham assumes you''re already familiar with many Lisp operators.  I don''t actually think that''s a big problem, and you shouldn''t let it scare you away from at least trying to read it.  I think it''s easier to read the first few chapters of On Lisp first and get excited about looking up the details, than it is to slog through a reference or a mundane introduction beforehand.I''ve set aside Lisp again, (though I''m keeping my eye open for opportunities to use it), though I have obtained a copy of ANSI Common Lisp which I also highly recommend.  Even if you don''t need the introduction, the book includes a large reference section that''s a bit more ''user-friendly'' than CTL2.  The last significant reference I''ve used is Practical Common Lisp by Peter Siebel, which can be found online.On Lisp, by Paul Graham http:\\/\\/www.paulgraham.com\\/onlisp.htmlParadigms of Artificial Intelligence:  Case Studies on Common Lisp by Peter NorvigANSI Common Lisp by Paul GrahamThe GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual: http:\\/\\/www.gnu.org\\/software\\/emacs\\/manual\\/html_mono\\/elisp.htm...Practical Common Lisp by Peter Siebel http:\\/\\/www.gigamonkeys.com\\/book\\/Common Lisp the Language: 2nd Edition by Guy Steele http:\\/\\/www.cs.cmu.edu\\/afs\\/cs.cmu.edu\\/project\\/ai-repository\\/a...Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman http:\\/\\/mitpress.mit.edu\\/sicp\\/full-text\\/book\\/book.html', 1);\n",

Lisp''s parentheses are a turn off to everyone until they reach some critical mass of application and understanding.

Probably there are similar books in English, though I don''t know). Then I went on to reading existing Scheme\\/Lisp implementations and start hacking it.  Aubrey Jaffer''s SCM gave me a good idea of run-time data representations of Scheme and a simple mark-sweep GC.  I learned how to compile Scheme code by looking the output of Joel Bartlett''s Scheme-&#62;C.  STk (now stklos) showed the power of CLOS-style metaobject protocol by mapping Tk protocol to Scheme object cleanly like a magic.

Because resume that Steve recommends will keep you from getting a job doing java for the accounts recievable department of a big corp, and the resume that will get you that big corp java job will prevent you from getting an interview with Steve.

It was (and still is) a nice idea.Rails took a completely different approach, embracing the RDBMS as the model itself.  Rather than creating objects and pushing the design out to the RDBMS, you define the relational structure and allow Rails to extract an object model.  If you are doing basic CRUD operations, you may not have to think about SQL again, even in a reasonably complicated app, and the syntax is very clean.I just love it.

Ruby makes it prettier and cleaner, but you''re still just looping.  Unless you create a custom collection class that internally stores a hash organized by costs.  But the creation of the new class is extra overhead because the nominal unit is the single object.The counterexample is just as instructive.

In web development it gets even worse: as if my favorite programming language X plus SQL wasn''t enough, I mix up HTML, CSS and JavaScript - that''s at least 5 languages in total!Another problem is that from a programmer''s perspective databases are, put simply, arrays possibly with pointers. The only reason we can''t declare these structures as arrays\\/lists with pointers is that data can grow infinitely big and my favorite language X can''t handle that. In other words, using databases is a classical example of premature optimization that comes at a price of overcomplicated code.

None hit it big.\\n\\nSo earlier this year the guru of Silicon Valley start-ups decided to fund a really dumb idea that cost as little as possible.In May, Kawasaki started Truemors, a site specializing in what it calls \\\"true rumors\\\" submitted by readers. It cost less than $13,000 to launch and was almost immediately dubbed \\\"the worst site ever\\\" by a leading European technology news site.Why would a respected venture capitalist and author of bestselling business books make a site like Truemors his next act? Because Kawasaki, 53, wanted to get firsthand experience with a user-generated, Web 2.0, social-media Web site.He also felt that starting the site would illustrate what he saw as a problem with venture capital - these Web 2.0 sites did not need lots of funding, and even if they did it was becoming harder for VCs to pick the winners.For nine years, Kawasaki and his partners had invested millions of dollars in companies that seemed like smart bets. They had their share of successes, but nothing on the order of Google or Yahoo.Meanwhile, ideas he dismissed became stock market sensations.Like Yahoo. In 1995, venture capitalist Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital asked Kawasaki if he''d like to interview to be chief executive of Yahoo. \\\"It was a list of David and Jerry''s (co-founders Filo and Yang) favorite Web sites,\\\" Kawasaki recalled. \\\"It had no business plan.\\\"Kawasaki said no. Years passed. Two guys from Stanford created yet another search engine. \\\"The 15th search engine - what a dumb idea,\\\" Kawasaki quipped about his reaction. That turned into Google.\\\"The only thing you can conclude is that it''s a crap shoot,\\\" Kawasaki said in a recent interview at his home office in Atherton. \\\"You have no idea what is going to succeed.\\\"Bill Reichert, Kawasaki''s partner at Garage Technology Ventures, said the tipping point for his partner came after Kawasaki chaired a panel discussion featuring start-ups like Hot or Not - a Web site where men and women submit photos to be rated by strangers - and Plenty of Fish - a free dating site.Neither site had raised venture capital, but both were enjoying advertising sales of more than a million dollars a year. That made it clear to the folks at Garage that the problem was the venture capital model itself, which seemed out of whack.Kawasaki decided to find out how little it cost to start a Web 2.0 company himself. He paid $4,500 to Web developers in South Dakota whom he had met through his personal blog. He spent $4,824 on legal fees. He spent almost $3,000 more on a logo, domain names and other miscellaneous expenses.And he began devoting himself to what he truly loved: Selling products and ideas.At Apple Computer in the 1980s and 1990s, Kawasaki had helped turn Macintosh users into Apple fanatics. He left the company in 1997, and made a career as a venture capitalist and speaker. His book \\\"The Art of the Start\\\" became a bible for would-be entrepreneurs.Some of his key advice: \\\"Don''t be afraid of polarizing people,\\\" and \\\"Don''t let the bozos grind you down.\\\"Two days after he launched Truemors, Kawasaki discovered the value of his own advice.Kawasaki had wanted the site to be a place where news and gossip met. He imagined his average reader as a Google programmer who was about to go on a date with an East Bay non-profit activist.What would they talk about? Truemors could help. Its news items covered everything from politics to sports, Hollywood gossip and technology culled from the Web and, occasionally, firsthand accounts.\\\"I promise, if you read Truemors, it will make you a more interesting person,\\\" Kawasaki said.Unlike Digg, a similar user-generated site that lets people rank stories on its front page, Truemors lists stories in the order they were submitted. Users can vote to move a story to a \\\"Greatest\\\" page - or to the dumpster if they think something is untrue.The blogosphere''s first reaction to Truemors was a blistering attack. A hacker broke in. Obscenities were submitted as news. Kawasaki himself was trashed.\\\"I have a very low opinion of the blogosphere,\\\" Kawasaki said. \\\"I think it is made up of about 250,000 people who are mostly 45-year-old men who live with their mother and have dead cats in their refrigerators.\\\"Kawasaki didn''t let the bozos get him down. He cleaned up his site. The attacks quickly died down.Earlier this month, the European news outfit with the scathing early review recanted. \\\"We''re big enough to admit that Truemors is definitely not the world''s worst Web site any longer,\\\" Martin Veitch, executive editor of IT Week, wrote in a Sept. 10 article on theinquirer.net, a technology news site.Kawasaki said the coverage was responsible for a huge spike in page views, which are now averaging about 150,000 a month, according to Google analytics.Drew Curtis, founder of FARK, a Web site of interesting and amusing news stories that was one of Kawasaki''s inspirations, said those numbers are pretty good. He said FARK, which now gets 53 million page views a month, got only 50,000 page views in its first year. FARK was launched in 1999.\\\"He certainly has critical mass,\\\" Curtis said of Kawasaki.Kawasaki insists he wants the site to be a success, but he acknowledges that the stakes are not high. His monthly break-even point is only $3,000.Kawasaki is still a venture capitalist and continues working with Garage''s portfolio of companies. \\\"Truemors helps me understand Web 2.0 better than any other experience,\\\" he said. \\\"Life is good for entrepreneurs these days.\\\"', 0);\n",

Get your partner in on the loan somehow, too. No matter how much you trust him\\/her, it''s not really fair to you to expect you to take all that risk while your partner takes on none.2. Reassess your situation and set reasonable expectations. How long will a loan last for? Is that long enough to finish the brunt of the work?

But they have to carry a 5,000-10,000 patient load while each patient gets 15 minute appointments.  Some docs routinely see over 20 patients a day.  This guy is charging a $500 retainer for two visits a year.  That means that if he has 300 patients, he''s making what a regular GP makes at an HMO.  If each patient has two visits a year, that means that he can have 2 appointments a day and make the same amount as an HMO doc.  That''s his break even point.  Anything over that, and it''s gravy.  I''m willing to bet that he has a 500 patient load.  So, he''s bringing in $250,000 net plus extra visits and appointments.  So, by going cash only, he''s probably making twice what an insurance doc would make.    This guy also does house calls only. So, he doesn''t have the overhead that he''d normally have with an office--staff, office rent, equipment, etc...  He doesn''t have to hire billing specialists.  He outsources all of his X-Ray and lab work, so no overhead there.  And, he has an unofficial network of non-jerk specialists that he can refer people to that he likes working with.  I''m surprised that this hasn''t caught on more than it has.  If you''re his patient, look at his appointment schedule.  He''s giving people a half-hour to one hour time slots.  And, he does a lot of his consultations over the wire, via IM, video chat and cell phone.  He probably doesn''t have to see his patients most of the time, and it''s a lot easier for his patients to get in touch with him.  His patients are happier and he has a much better quality of life.  Brilliant.', 0);\n",

Sarb-Ox has really clamped down on the number of IPO''s that are occuring now.  So, even though there might be hubris around web apps right now, the average investor has no way of pumping money into those businesses, and that''s a good thing.  What start-ups are creating are several products in tandem:  The first is software that actually does stuff.  The second is a community of users that develop and grow around that software product.  The third is a small tight-knit group of people who have proven their capacity to produce.  Big Co is interested in all three of those things.  And Big Co has proven repeatedly that they are willing to shell out a bunch of cash to aquire the software, the community or the people.  Even if the startup isn''t profitable, the software, community and people are still very valuable to companies that need those things.  What start-ups aren''t creating this time around is IPO fever where the stock price gets ramped up while the founders and employees cash out.  This is what''s going to prevent the next big bubble from forming around web apps for quite a while this time around.  The fundamentals are much better this time around.', 1);\n",

It took a LONG time to develop a C++ server, the client was more simple.Security in c++ is hard, memory leaks are hard, crashing on high load is hard to debug. What I learnt from this was... servers are hard and takes a long time to debug. Going with python\\/perl\\/C# would have saved us time on memory leaks and some of the crashing (no buffer overruns etc). The downside would be that the server may be slower. BUT the cost to develop the C++ server was about the cost of 40 servers so we could have written a slower app that scaled and bought more servers and rackspace. I estimate choosing c++ added about 6-8 months to the task. Even as I left, while relatively stable the code is brittle and there is only one engineer left who knws the code and he is too chicken to change anything. Launch pressures meant there was ''not time'' for unit tests (plenty of time to dig a large hole though)Think hard about your requirements. Most severs spend most of their time waiting. Either the filesystem, database or on high load reading from memory\\/swap. So the CPU is often under utilised. Interpreted languages while slower can give a similar performance profile to c\\/c++ but with more cpu utilisation. When you have a LOT of sockets open you can spend a lot of time waiting for the kernel to poke you (even with kqueue or io completion ports).Either way, don''t write the underlying server code yourself there are frameworks in ALL languages that will get you 90% of the way.

Often times, the processing will involve the same software modules, so each problem is not unique.

Depending on the nature of your startup, it may be more or less valuable to make the move to the Valley.  Here''s a few factors that seem relevant to that evaluation.1. Access to capitalIf your company has large upfront capital requirements, then being in a setting with VC''s who aren''t afraid to take a risk has obvious benefits.  However, a lot of web 2.0 startups have relatively low starting costs. You can self-finance the development and launch of a product which attracts a rapidly growing userbase.  The main cost isn''t even monetary, its opportunity cost.  With this done, attracting VC interest is a lot easier, regardless of where you are.2. Access to talentNaively, the Bay Area has a lot more talent than other locations and this makes it a better place to do a startup.  Problem is, the competition for talent is a lot tougher.  If you''re a startup in a place with relatively few startups, you have a real shot at attracting the top programmers locally, because you''re the only game in town.  In the Bay Area you''re competing against Google, Facebook and all the rest.I''m in Waterloo, Canada, and this is evident locally.  Waterloo has a terrific undergrad CS program - supposedly, its Microsoft''s number one recruiting School - and lots of really talented developers.  But there are relatively few Web 2.0 companies in town, which means that startups have (if they''re willing to work at it) access to an amazingly talented pool of potential employees, and a real shot at hiring those people.I don''t think one even needs a top CS school locally.  My background is as a theoretical physicist, and my observation is that at least in theoretical physics the quality of the top students is pretty much the same everywhere.  I''d be surprised if there was much difference in CS.  There will be more extraordinary programmers in the MIT CS program, but they will still be there at Podunk State University, and if you''re careful and aim high, you''ll have a real shot at getting those people onboard.  3. CultureI don''t mean art and a nice orchestra.  I mean access to a \\\"can-do\\\" culture, full of sharp people who are plugged in, full of the latest news, insightful (and original!) analysis, and can act as role models, mentors, advisors, and so on.  Really sharp criticism and suggestions are worth their weight in gold.This is something where the Startup Hubs have a major advantage.  It also seems to me perhaps the biggest advantage of the YC program - the dinners and other events.  In places that are less of a Hub it seems to me that you need to consciously build a really wide network of people who can act in that role for you.  This requires work anywhere, but it is a lot harder in somewhere without a startup culture than it is in the Valley.4. Access to other companiesFor some startups it''s really important to have access to other companies for partnerships, distribution and so on.  For others it''s much less important.  Obviously, in the former situation being in a Hub has a major benefit, while in the latter situation it is less so.', 0);\n",

If you live in the same place as them, even if you aren''t going to a startup-oriented social event, you still have a good chance of running into them and striking up a conversation.Case in point -- my cousin wants to make movies.  So he decided to move to LA and get a job as a bartender.  He went to bartending school and then got a job at a bar that is frequented by producers and other movie industry folk.

In fact, I followed Paul''s advice about three weeks ago when I left Charlotte, NC to move to Sunnyvale, CA in hopes of starting a start-up (or at least working at one).  In non-hub cities, I would hear all the time about how I needed 10-15 years of experience to start my own company; maybe 1 out of 20 people would take me seriously.  (To tell the truth, most people would assume I was starting some sort of manufacturing-like company.  They would ask me where I was going to find the capital for such a huge investment).  That sort of negative energy can weigh on anyone, and I knew I had to get to a place where I felt more accepted for this ambition.On that topic, now that I have left my job (for the move), I would really like to get involved at a start-up out here.  I loved working my tail off while I was at college and hated (barely) working at work for the past year.  I really want to get back into nose to the grindstone working to build something cool.  Anybody have a good idea how to get the ball rolling.  I am teaching myself a few extra programming languages, but I feel like I need to get with the right people to get things off the ground.Anyway, great essay Paul.  Sometimes I wonder if the start-up companies will revolutionize \\\"work\\\" in a way that factories and unions changed the landscape of America during the 19th and 20th centuries.  Are we that far away from a start-up being the norm?  I suppose not everyone could work at a start-up, how could a start-up expand to a larger corporation if everyone is working at a start-up?  But, I could see the mentality switch such that students work for\\/start a start-up for 2-3 years after college, if it succeeds, great, if not, they go work for a larger company or go to grad school.

        "insert into Comments(id,post_id, content, rating) VALUES (2433, 487, 'Berkeley is dirty, expensive, and everything closes at 9pm sharp. Anticorporatism is strong so most shops are coops or expensive food stores. The college environment and the college kids somewhat make up for it, the atmosphere is hard to beat.San Francisco is crowded, expensive, and it''s a second-rate NYC. But the proximity to everything and everyone again makes up for a lot, especially for cuisine and nightlife. Driving is pain, housing is a pain.Milpitas is cheap, full of housing, but next to the city dump. It smells in the summer and since there''s so much suburban sprawl, you''ll drive for half an hour before reaching the highway. Everything closes early too, there''s no downtown or nightlife. Mountain View: tract homes suburban sprawl. Mountain View has one long strip called Castro street that masquerades as a downtown on certain days. Other than that it''s just old 60''s tract housing style (you''ll find this to be the case for almost all of Silicon Valley).Sunnyvale is like a pseudo commercial zone where all the warehouses and tiny offices are. Imagine playing SimCity and watching your purple zone languishing. That''s Sunnyvale. It''s definitely cheaper though to live because of this effect. There''s a Fry''s and Costco here, meaning you don''t need to go anywhere else. Cupertino\\/Saratoga has one big hit: Apple. There''s no downtown, everything closes at 9pm sharp. Cupertino is essentially where everyone commutes back to after working in SF or Sunnyvale. There are an abundance of police officers because of the odd arrangement the city has with the county to generate revenue. Saratoga is up in the hills which is pretty but basically excludes anyone without a seven digit network.Palo Alto is schizophrenic in that it doesn''t know whether it''s a farm town, college town, ritzy retreat, or corporate shill. Stanford is here and the surrounding area outside of Stanford is great. Sand Hill Road is right outside, there''s a strip that act as the downtown, significantly longer than Castro. But because of Stanford it attracts quite a lot of companies to move here which in turn forces house pricing through the roof. Facebook is based here and they pay their employees an extra $600 to live within a 1 mile radius, meaning your chances are next to nothing to get a nice place. Watch out for East Palo Alto, that''s not a place you want to be.Santa Clara is like the ice cream center of a cake. It slowly melts into either layer but in the mean time it acts as the barrier between the sponge up top and the ghetto area on the bottom. This is where most people go because of the lower housing pricing due to market pressures. It''s not a bad area, but then again it''s not the sunny disposition you would expect California to be known for. This is also where my stolen car ended up at. Twice. East San Jose. This isn''t meant to be racist: east San Jose is where most of the poor live, there''s a huge Mexican and Vietnamese community here. This is also where the low-rent and section-8 apartments are and where most of the illegal immigrants will bus from to find work at Home Depot in other areas. This isn''t in any way to degenerate them, but this is just how the city is broken up into. Go more east and near the mountains and you end up at this ritzy and rich community called Silver Creek where they built thousands of big houses. You can drive for an hour here and still not see the main highway. San Jose itself is huge. In fact, it''s bigger than San Francisco, ranking itself as the 3rd biggest city in California. There''s a downtown, but it''s not as glamorous as say New York nor LA. Plenty of clubs to go to but it''s almost always full of cop cars, low riders, scrapers with big wheels, and sound system that''s enough to shatter glass. Quite a lot of companies are here though, Adobe for one, and the recent clamor for city living has caused quite a few skyscrapers to go up for loft living and the like. Prepare to pluck down more than $750k for a 900sq ft loft with sky high windows that look directly into a depressing airport. Oh, at least they have the courtesy to shut off the airport after 9pm (apparently everyone sleeps at 9 in Silicon Valley). There''s multiple museums though, but they have enough content to last you through maybe 3 weekends. \\nThis turned out more pessimistic than I had originally intended it to be. It''s not to say I hate Silicon Valley, but the wide-eyed optimism has worn off. Don''t think it''s a dreamland, it''s just an certain area where lots of people have moved into. The new trend now is to tear down unoccupied commercial zones (caused by the first dot-com boom) and remaking them as condos. Expensive condos. It''s only getting more and more people to come in. Traffic is annoying. Stuff is expensive. There''s houses everywhere. And most areas lack charm. So in summation, where would I go?With a bit more money saved up, I would much prefer Palo Alto, it''s by far the best area, a 30 minute drive to the City (that''s what we call San Francisco) and close proximity to Mountain View. If I just need a cheap place to stay? Santa Clara. If I want to live the California life? San Francisco. If I have a family? Cupertino. If I really really really want to have a house? Milpitas. Don''t take this post as gospel though. I''ve only been living here for 15 years and can''t say I have truly captured ever nuance of Silicon Valley. \\nAddendum: Oakland. It''s in a renovation stage. What used to be a horrifying place to live at is now being revitalized for business and as a contra to SF. The popular trend amongst my friends and smaller startups is live in SF or Fremont\\/Union City and rent an office in Oakland. You can find a huge 1500 sq ft open loft\\/warehouse type office for less than $1.50\\/sqft. I still wouldn''t live in Oakland though.\\n', 2);\n",

Even in this program, some courses were definitely more valuable than others.Not long past the point where it was too late to change majors, something astounded me.  I discovered a pattern to the valuable courses.  It was as follows:The most valuable high-level courses were the theoretical computer science courses (the foundations of CS series, AI stuff, the sort of thing where you''re asked, \\\"How would you solve this problem?\\\").  The most valuable low-level courses were the concrete courses in things other than computer science (mostly math and physics; to a lesser extent, various engineering disciplines).  If you think about it, this actually makes sense:  the courses about solving problems, following the courses that give you the tools to do that.If you think about it, there''s a good reason for this:  Low level courses exist to provide a foundation for more advanced courses.  This means that they are not designed for people who already intuitively understand their subject matter.  If you already know C, Java, and two or three other languages like Pascal, you can learn Perl, Prolog, and Scheme on your own -- you don''t need a professor to teach them to you (though it might help to have someone get you to use macros).  You just need to understand that language''s \\\"thing\\\" (punctuation, assertions\\/derivations, first-class functions\\/closures\\/continuations) and then it will almost learn itself.  If you already know how to build a pointer-based binary tree, you don''t need a course to tell you how to build a radix tree, or a red-black tree, or a trie.On the other hand, the low level courses in other disciplines are designed for people who don''t already intuitively understand that area.  That makes them perfect for you.Unfortunately, most universities do try to curtail the obvious solution by enforcing prerequisite courses.  This makes little sense from a teaching perspective, but it makes perfect sense from a \\\"raising the average GPA of their students\\\" perspective.Almost anywhere you go, you''ll find the ability to game the system somehow -- be it alternate prerequisites, testing out of things, or taking a minor in CS instead of a major.

(leading to statements that, out of his twisted context, are totally bewildering like \\&quot;its capabilities are complex\\&quot;.)\\nHis argument about simplicity and complexity not being mutually exclusive is a matter of definition, and thus he undermines others by foisting his definition into their mouths and then screaming bloody murder when he deduces that changing the premises of someone&#x27;s argument does indeed damage its conclusions.\\nAmong other things I think his comparison of stats between Mongrel and Fogbugz is fundamentally broken. Mongrel is among other things free. Beyond the intense need to brag about his project&#x27;s success I can&#x27;t see any legitimate reason for making that particular comparison.\\n(Beyond this point I rant about his usage of Hangul for his example, feel free to skip rest of post.)\\nHis comprehension of the Korean writing system, which is one of his \\&quot;powerful\\&quot; points, seems superficial at best. Hangul is a language that was designed by a small group of advisors when the royalty realized most koreans were illiterate (not enough resources to spend learning chinese kanji). How the hell are we supposed to be surprised that something explicitly designed to be simple, in fact, turned out to be simple? Some extra points can be deducted for the fact that they stopped using hangul for several hundred years until it was institutionalized by the strong nationalist movement post WWII and made the official writing system in an effort to establish a unique Korean culture. Additionally we can pause curiously while noting that the average Korean still uses 700-800 Chinese kanji in daily life, and that academic papers still use the kanji for particularly esoteric or complex concepts (although this is increasingly discouraged as it is viewed as elitism). He crucifies Joel and Don for using limited examples to justify a point... and then use a single example to prove his, along with unsubstantiated claims about linguistic researchers. The Japanese katakana alphabet can represent many words very well... until you try to do one with an L in it, and then it fails utterly. Using one contrived example wouldn&#x27;t reveal that, and its the same reason I doubt his point about hangul.\\nBeyond technicalities, its ignorant to conflate the creation of one small group of individuals six hundred years ago with the cultural preferences of modern Korea.

This makes the old STL way more useful.  To be sure the syntax can be a bit funky...boost::bind pulls all the fun of boost::lamda and boost::function together.With only the tiniest bit of discipline boost::shared_ptr&#x27;s mean you never have to worry about memory management again.  boost::any and QVariants (from the Qt Libraries) help you manage dynamic typing.  So an array of boost::any&#x27;s can hold int&#x27;s, char&#x27;s, string&#x27;s and AnyTypeYouWant&#x27;s all at the same time.  Everything I&#x27;ve mentioned is either in the standard or will be soon.  Really undergrad C++ is only the beginning.  The STL and boost are almost a language unto themseleves.  I never use raw arrays or naked pointers anymore and it&#x27;s made development WAY faster while maintaining performance.PG asked, why use a language where adaptors have to be built to get the functionality of lisp rather than lisp itself (or something like that.)  I see his point but if the effort of getting lisp to work with C\\/C++ based code is greater than the pain of using an LFM, why not make the best of an LFM?Has anyone had the same experience?

It took a few hours but what you get with abstractions is a loss of control over implementation. When you use the tighter loop, the compiler turns everything (roughly) into this:Iterator it=list.iterator(); \\/\\/Which calls new ListItr();\\nfor (it.hasNext())\\n{\\nObject next=it.next();The abstraction has to do that because it doesn&#x27;t know whether the list (really, the java.util.Collection) is a LinkedList or an ArrayList or a Set. If your loop itself is in a tight loop, it isn&#x27;t hard to call it millions and millions of times during program execution--which makes millions and millions of unnecessary allocations and method calls. There is a loss of performance which, at the end of the day, is more important than how much you enjoy your job. Of course, other languages would allow you to specify an implementation for a given abstraction.</td>\n",

And sometimes I think that web designers would do well to add a little unavoidable suffering.Some of these new websites seem user centric to the point of being obsequious.

Even the sharpest programmer can only type so fast, and even the fastest compiler can only compile so fast. The only way for projects like that to come to fruition in any reasonable amount of time is for people to work long hours.The nature of software startups has changed. With web apps, the code base is relatively small and simple. There usually isn&#x27;t a compile cycle. What happens now, is you spend all your time on systems administration issues. Shit breaks, you need to respond to it immediately. I sort of miss the days where programming 70 hours a week was an option.

I joined a startup straight out of college as employee #13 (at the time, it had about 8 employees in the office at any given time).  It was profitable, I liked the people, and they were doing some pretty cool stuff.Overall, I would do it over again but probably will not remain with them for much longer, if that makes any sense.   Some observations:The language choice will grate on you after a while.  I dunno what the background of posters saying \\&quot;Be professional.  Suck it up.\\&quot; is, but I actually liked Java coding when I started, and have since learned to hate it.  If you&#x27;re going in with a strong aversion to Java &amp;#38; C++ already, it&#x27;ll probably only get worse.Flip side is that you do get better at these languages after you work with them a while, as long as you keep an open mind.  There are tricks and tools in C++ to help you manage memory - you shouldn&#x27;t be tracing pointers from new to delete.  And Java&#x27;s verbosity isn&#x27;t as bad once you get used it and consider \\&quot;for(int i = 0; i &amp;#60; array.length; ++i)....\\&quot; to be a single map function that just has a really long name. ;-)One question to ask that&#x27;ll help you determine if the language will end up becoming a total drag: are they using it because the problem fits the language&#x27;s strengths, or are they using it because they don&#x27;t know any better and aren&#x27;t comfortable with multi-language solutions?  Every mainstream language is good for something.  In my case, I was perfectly happy as long as I was writing IDE plugins and server software in Java, and then became very unhappy once I had to write a webapp.  (IMNSHO, Java is irredeemably broken for webapps; the only sane way to do them is to strip out all the JavaEE bullshit and program on bare servlets, but then you get something that&#x27;s nowhere near as nice as Python\\/PHP\\/Perl.)There are plenty of things beyond programming that you learn from working in a successful (profitable) startup.  OTOH, it&#x27;s not rocket science.  Basically, you can boil it all down to: 1.) Make something people want, 2.) Charge more for it than it costs you, and 3.) Fix problems now rather than later.  Every failed startup I&#x27;ve been involved with has neglected at least one of these: every successful startup has done all three.I dunno what you expect financially out of this, but be aware that founders get rich, late-stage employees get paid, and early-stage employees get screwed.  At least in proportion to the amount of effort they put in.  One startup I worked in went bust, taking my 0.1% of stock options with it.  One that I interviewed at offered me about 0.01% of the company; I did the math, and calculated that at their expected $40M exit, I would get a whole $4000.  I have no equity at my current employer.  My cubemate was an early employee at CCBN, which was sold to Thomson for about $40M.  He got $3K or so.  I have another friend who was employee #35 at Stratus and later a VP; she was rich for a while when they ended up with a billion-$ market cap, but ended up poor again after the stock crashed.  If you plan on being an early employee at a startup, you should do it for learning or for the experience rather than any perceived financial rewards.</td>\n",

To avoid cheating, we send them a couple of code snippets right as we call them. Then, we talk about the code.We found that phone screeners have a bias toward those who speak well, so we often brought in terrible programmers for a half day of interviews. What a waste, especially when flying people in.  The in-person failures we experienced were of the FizzBuzz variety, not the \\&quot;I don&#x27;t exactly under stand concurrency\\&quot; sort.So, we started asking people to read some code and comment on it.  Really basic Java stuff: Will this code compile?  Trace the flow of execution through this method if the BlahException was thrown.  String comparisons with ==.  The idea was to see if (1) the person was at all clueful, and (2) if they had actually written Java code.  As the linked blogger noted, the disparity in responses is shocking. We found that about half the people we interviewed thought that execution of a Java method ceased once a catch block had been entered.  Half!  How could they ever have written robust production code?  These were often people with years of Java experience on their resumes.  I just don&#x27;t understand how someone could write a bunch of Java code and not understand the basics of how exceptions work.Some other parts of the code review were more nuanced.  Most candidates knew that one should not compare strings using double equals, but they usually couldn&#x27;t explain why.  Nor did they understand why == sometimes seems to work when comparing a referenced String object to a literal. We were happy to hire smart candidates that hadn&#x27;t done a lot of Java work, but we wanted to avoid people who had supposedly spent years with a language and didn&#x27;t even comprehend the basics. </td>\n",

These two factors become critical when there is a tradeoff between probability of success and the payoff of success.Suppose, as a simple example, that I have a startup which I think has a 50% chance of succeeding and being sold for $1M, and a 50% chance of failing and being worthless.  Now suppose that Paul selects me to participate in YC, but wants 10% of the company, and I think his help will leave the potential valuation unchanged but increase the chance of success from 50% to 55%.  If I accept his offer, my EXPECTED return drops from $500k (50% of $1M) to $495k (55% of $900k) -- but I&#x27;d still accept the offer, because increasing my chance of getting that first $900k is worth far more than getting an additional $100k on top of that.On the other hand, suppose a venture capital company comes along and offers to help me expand into a much larger market, where I&#x27;d have a 10% chance of the company being worth $100M (and a 90% chance of the company being worthless), in exchange for taking 50% of the company stock.  If I accept the offer, my EXPECTED return jumps from $500k to $5M (10% of $50M) -- but there&#x27;s no way that I&#x27;d accept the offer, because I really don&#x27;t want to spend years of my life on something which has a 90% chance of being worthless.It&#x27;s important to understand the numbers, but in the end the numbers, at best, have to guide you rather than making decisions for you.</td>\n",

              "            <td>Well, server optimization has been my primary hobby for the past month, and I&#x27;d like to make some clarifications about a few things the article says.Saying that Lighttpd supports \\&quot;CGI scripts, Ruby on Rails, Pylons, TurboGears, Django, Quixote, webpy, Mongrel, Catalyst, Mason, Joomla, AWStats, and so much more\\&quot; is kind of misleading. Lighttpd can do a few things: it does fast cgi (fcgi support explains about 75% of the examples in that list), it can serve static files, and it can proxy requests to other servers. Lighttpd doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;support Mongrel\\&quot;, because Mongrel is another server. What Lighttpd does is use something akin to mod_proxy to send certain requests somewhere else, that somewhere else might be a Mongrel cluster that is running on port 8080 (hence it \\&quot;supports\\&quot; Mongrel).\\nThat proxying service is where the majority of Lighttpd usage has been. A typical efficient setup these days (YouTube does along these lines) is to have lighttpd accept incoming requests and if the request is for a static file then it serves the request (because it is very lightweight (i.e. minimal) it is more efficient than Apache at serving static media), and if it is for dynamic content the request is passed to Apache, which then passes it back to Lighttpd, which passes it back to the requester (this means that \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; Apache threads will be dedicated to a request for a shorter period of time since it only has to communicate\\/wait for Lighttpd instead of the actual requester).\\nLighttpd on its own isn&#x27;t necessarily the best solution (an example from my experience is that mod_python and Apache become more efficient at serving dynamic content than fcgi and Lighttpd as the numbers of requester per second get very high). Usually a combination of a light frontend server and Apache in the backend can provide the best performance (again this is at high numbers, at lower numbers lighttpd is probablly equally or more efficient).\\nAs a final note, I&#x27;d really recommend Nginx over Lighttpd if you are looking for a light http server to serve static content, support fcgi, and\\/or proxy to other servers. The biggest reason? Lighttpd leaks memory and has to be restarted occasionally because every couple of days (under heavy usage) it dies. Not a great feature in a production server.</td>\n",

My point then is that you need all of the above.  If you have connections, capital and a good idea - then sorry, you&#x27;re a carbon copy of thousands of other tech entrepreneurs.  What separates you from them?  Anyone can always get more capital if you poke around a bit.  Anyone can get more connections if you spend more time schmoozing.

That is what I learned from this experience.\\&quot;Problem 1: trying to build 3 apps while doing consulting work (no focus)\\&quot;Definitely.  I absolutely agree.  However, we were in no position to argue (much) and as I said in the post, the relationship we had with the supposed investor was flawed.\\&quot;Problem 2: the author was a dick to his only employee (wtf? why?)\\&quot;Ken wasn&#x27;t an employee.  He was being paid the same as me and provided similar functions, although I naturally took on more of a leadership role, being the more experienced.  I&#x27;m a dick anyway, but yes, I was hard on Ken because I expected him to help me as much as possible not to fuck up the opportunity I thought we had.  But when you are ready to launch and you find that there are lots of basic errors in the HTML or front end code because advice you&#x27;ve given over and over hasn&#x27;t been taken in, it&#x27;s hard to remain cool and collected, especially if it&#x27;s with a mate.If anything, being in that situation taught me that I am not fit to be a boss and not fit to team lead.  I am much better working alone, and my individual work speaks for itself.  That is why I am now leaning towards solo consulting as the focus of my career.\\n</td>\n",

So, keep that in mind when reading my comments below.This is an idea I&#x27;ve heard before. I agree that everything in the world is going to the web. File systems will become distributed. Every application you use will come from the internet, with the exception of your kernel and the software needed to retrieve the applications. They&#x27;ll probably run remotely, too, and just send you the graphics\\/UI.However, I think that turning the web browser into a window manager is going in the wrong direction. It completely disobeys the Unix philosophy of writing programs that do one thing well. Firefox&#x27;s role in the future should be rendering and running remote applications. Organizing the apps using tabs, MDI, windows, workspaces, viewports, etc. should be left to the people who are spending all of their time thinking about how to organize applications.</td>\n",

You are already supposing that Linux (an actual operating system) exists underneath.Isn&#x27;t Internet Explorer + Windows Explorer + Web Folders pretty much doing this already? Windows&#x27; Web Folders feature lets you store documents remotely and access them over HTTP from regular (non-web-enabled) applications. Internet Explorer lets you browse the local filesystem and the web from the same browser window pretty seamlessly.It seems that Firefox is indeed becoming an application deployment platform. However, it doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea to me. Instead of having one package manager in the operating system, there will be two: one system package manage and one Firefox package manager. There are all kinds of security and manageability problems with that. Already, there are many buggy Firefox plugins that cripple the browser, effectively causing a DOS attack with crashes and decreased performance. This is a good indication that we should not have confidence in Firefox&#x27;s abilities to manage third party applications. Really Firefox should be in that business at all, since resource allocation and crash prevention are fundamentally operating system features. The right solution is to improve the installation experience provided by the operating system, and have it provide security-oriented integration capabilities for applications (as opposed to to the performance-oriented integration capabilities we have now). This would require the operating system to provide a sandboxed environment by default to downloaded applications. The OS needs to provide a middle ground between the almost unrestricted access given to today&#x27;s downloaded applications, and the totally restricted access given to web apps; that access needs to be very close to the web app side.With this kind of severely-limited sandbox, we can then eliminate the whole UI of application installation. Instead of installation, we would just have caching. Instead of a list of programs in \\&quot;Add\\/Remove Programs,\\&quot; we would just have a \\&quot;Free up XXX MB of disk space\\&quot; page.</td>\n",

I think I can agree that have a landing page take up 100% of the available width is a bad thing, but it&#x27;s not because the user is spending time turning their head to read content (that&#x27;s a pretty poor argument);<br> rather it&#x27;s because users like to see visual boundaries -- where the content of the site begins and ends. Your widened versions appear to do a poor job of managing the space and as a result look more amateur than the thinner, more condensed versions. There are multiple problems that I can spot right away with your widescreen version -- for example, the user preferred width of a column of text is 3.5\\&quot;, and the right-hand utilities section of the header appears to be disconnected from the rest of the page. Problems such as those, stemming from the design of the page (independent of its width) are probably more than enough to explain the difference in bounce rates.\\&quot;Furthermore, are you arguing that the decision made by CNN, Digg, CNet (et al.) to switch to a native 1024x768 design was wrong?

In case that you are not satisfied with our service, you can keep the device and get a refund of your remaining subscription balance minus the prorated portion of your Zonbu hardware rebate. Let&#x27;s take an example: if you choose the 50 GB every two year billing plan, you initially pay $99 + 24  $14.95 = $457.80. If you cancel the service after six months, you keep the device and we reimburse you: $119.10 = $14.95  18 - $150. Also, once your subscription terminates, you have read-only access to your data for three months, both from your Zonbu device and from any other remote access PC.

It&#x27;s a simpler solution than requiring accounts -- there&#x27;s less friction for a user to begin interacting with your site (ie no registration process) -- but doing things like tracking accounts and providing reliable usage stats is pretty difficult.Additionally, your users will never be able to (easily) sych between computers and to be honest you&#x27;ll eventually add user accounts anyway.

My advice would be to sketch out a road map and assume that you will eventually add some sort of user account -- and then architect your site so that when you make that transition your users won&#x27;t lose all of their data (as will be the case for photoflock&#x27;s history data).</td>\n",

I always thought that user registration adds friction to any app. I guess it all comes down to how it&#x27;s implemented and how easy it is to get user from point A to B on your app.(e.g. reddit&#x27;s way of user registration comes mind) Although the implementation of OpenID should ease that restriction a bit.

If you are writing Windows Forms in C# using Visual Studio you could easily write 1,000 lines of code in an hour (because the IDE makes them for you).  Similarly, if you are merely typing up what should be done by an ORM product, then you can easily write 1,000 lines of code in a day.  I&#x27;ve had 3-4kloc days doing the combination of these two.  It&#x27;s possible because the coding is easy, and you have tools to help you do it.  Also, are we counting things like macros in this estimation?

I came to the conclusion that since Paul was a published author of Lisp books at the time, and saw an opportunity to use it in production (maybe to gain experience and write another book about it to share his findings with others) but ended up learning about startups, dot coms, investors, and users as well, he instead wrote essays on paulgraham.com and used some of them in his Hackers and Painters book.I dare say his essays are about starting up in general, and there is no secret plan to convert users into using Lisp.  Every week on YCombinator Startup News, somebody asks about learning Lisp to do a web app, when there are way more other things to worry about than the language.  Use something you want to use every day, not just in theory because someone else did.  I&#x27;d learn an unknown language if I was at a startup that used it every day, but otherwise, I would default to using a web framework that I have already used in the past.My conclusion is that if you&#x27;re creating a web application using a web framework in any language you find interesting at the moment, go for it.  Because that&#x27;s exactly what Paul did.  It just happened to be Lisp that he was an expert at, but it could have been any other exciting technology.Whether Paul would use Lisp today or not on a new project is irrelevant as far as your plate is concerned.  He could use Lisp, but it wouldn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t other good alternatives.  And if he did use a language other than Lisp, maybe it would be so because he would want to learn web framework since he wouldn&#x27;t be writing Lisp books any more, but Lisp may still be something he would normally use more often.I think this is a great question.</td>\n",

I&#x27;m still tempted to do this, but free wireless has spread so much it would be hard to penetrate the market and convince people my way was the best way.I regret not having the balls to say that three months living expenses was good enough, lets make a prototype and get a test going and pray I can find some business minded investors in time.</td>\n",

There&#x27;re three main drivers for this:1.) The cost of bandwidth continues to plummet.  YouTube showed that it&#x27;s feasible to stream decent-quality video to millions of users at once.2.) The cost of gas continues to skyrocket.  As commuting becomes more expensive, more knowledge workers will look for an alternative to commuting.  Given current technology, it&#x27;s easier simply not to drive than to find more fuel-efficient ways of driving.3.) Certain companies and projects are showing that it&#x27;s feasible to work in geographically distributed teams.  37signals has about half of their staff in the Chicago office.  The ICFP contest involves a very tricky task that&#x27;s usually performed by teams of half a dozen people distributed all around the globe.

Engineering school is all about showing you everything there is to know about a tool except what to use it for.  I think E-schools should be like obstacle courses where you have projects that REQUIRE understanding of a concept in order to complete them.  Classes about said concepts are given as the NEED arises.  Most E-schools suck.  Just take as many project based classes as possible (CS is decent for this) and get a degree.  Universities also have lots of grants that nobody knows about where you can get money to build cool things.  Maybe this is just me, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m alone.

As a result, the most creative ideas are shot down before they are given a chance to be refined.Instead, if you generate ideas on your own you can spend more time on a half-baked concept in order to round out its flaws. Then once its ready, other people can help provide different perspectives on the idea without shooting it down outright.

One thing I noticed time and time again in all these places is the prevalence of &#x27;internal marketing&#x27;. When stripped of trendy buzzwords and platitudes about &#x27;empowerment&#x27;, internal marketing is a De facto ideology which stipulates that marketing is the primary driving force in every organization. It places product quality, customer value, and strategy in a distant secondary position. The problem with marketing companies is that their myopic focus produces reactionary organizations - more ad hoc institutions than enterprises. &#x27;Marketing companies&#x27; are sometimes profitable, but rarely maintain a commanding market position for long if they get there in the first place. Contrast these with the real product companies of our time: Apple, Google, Craigslist, Facebook, Toyota. The real profit and value are being created by companies who focus on actual products. Some of these companies have little marketing apparatus at all, at least in the sense you&#x27;re talking about. This reminds me of a silly aphorism: You rob a bank because that&#x27;s where the money is. Providing seed funding to &#x27;marketing geniuses&#x27; is like robbing twenty hot dog stands and hoping that one of them forgot to deposit their earnings that week.

I&#x27;m a fairly skeptical person, and their tricks worked on me well into my thirties.\\&quot;It&#x27;s much easier to never get in the habit of buying things in the first place.  I remember two particular childhood events that dramatically shaped my consumption habits:In the first, I was 4 years old and in the toy section of Spag&#x27;s (a discount warehouse near Worcester), and really wanted a new Transformers toy.  My mom said \\&quot;Oh honey, we can&#x27;t afford it.  We can come back next month and get it.\\&quot;  And then ran over to take care of my sister, who was throwing a tantrum over not being able to have a My Little Pony doll.  I realized I could be the \\&quot;good child\\&quot; by never asking for stuff.  From then on, my parents and I had a tacit agreement: they would buy me anything I wanted, and in return I wouldn&#x27;t want much.  Lesson learned: sibling rivalry can be a powerful motivator.For the second - my parents refused to let us watch any TV other than PBS until they&#x27;d sat us down and told us about advertisements.  And when they did, the conversation was basically: \\&quot;The commercials are just trying to sell you something.  They want to control your behavior, so that you&#x27;ll go out and buy what they want.\\&quot;  I was 5 years old at the time and couldn&#x27;t bear the idea of anyone controlling my behavior.  After all, it was bad enough when my parents told me what to do.  The idea that some nefarious marketing guy would reach through the TV and make me spend money was just abhorrent.  Lesson learned: make marketers seem like parents, but with only the evil \\&quot;You have to do this!\\&quot; parts and not the comforting take-care-of-you parts.The end result of all this?

When they were kids, a new toy was a truly wonderful gift, and so they continue to give them.And yet their houses were relatively cheap relative to their incomes. For 20 and 30-ish people, the great financial challenge is housing, not plastic toys.  So stuff is very cheap, but a place to put that stuff is prohibitively expensive.  I have a feeling my 2 year old would really enjoy a toy workbench.  The item itself is awfully cheap, and I could probably get one for $25 on craigslist, but the real estate it&#x27;s sitting on is worth about $2k.(I live in one of the few remaining unfashionable blocks of San Francisco for the low low price of about $650\\/sq ft- on nob or russian hill this workbench would probably cover closer to $10k worth of floorspace).   So here&#x27;s another way to test a purchase.  Think about how much floor space the item would cover, and ask yourself if it&#x27;s worth the are*$\\/sqft.  </td>\n",

Those who grew up in the West can&#x27;t possibly understand how valuable even the most insignificant stuff seemed there.  Petty theft was rampant.  If you left a load of laundry unattended you could come back and find even your socks missing.  The \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; mindset is very difficult for some people to break.  Over the first few years living in the US, my mother had accumulated more useless stuff than most people who&#x27;d spent their whole lives here.  After 15 years in the US, she still worries about leaving her stuff in the laundromat.I&#x27;ve been thinking about the subject a lot over the years and Paul&#x27;s essay is spot-on.  The more money I make, the more I dislike \\&quot;stuff\\&quot;.  I hardly bought anything since I started my first job after college.  In contrast I used to buy a fair amount of junk before.  My room was always cluttered and I hated being at home because I felt like the stuff drained all my energy.It&#x27;s true that stuff owns people and not the other way around.  My neighbor in Cambridge, MA keeps a backyard (more like a junkyard) full of used construction materials and equipment, including 3 dead trucks.  He spends every single evening trying to straighten it out, but ends up just wheelbarrowing stuff from place to place without any noticeable progress.  I, on the other hand, am now able to spend every evening working on my startup, and not having stuff makes me feel great!</td>\n",

Oh, the rationalizations I came up with for purchases of very dubious value. I felt that I had to have every piece of the puzzle, only I didn&#x27;t realize that the puzzle can never be completed.Now that I&#x27;ve gone out on my own I don&#x27;t have the time or money to spend like this anymore. It&#x27;s such a change for the better.Here are some stuff-reduction techniques I use:Books: I have one large Ikea bookshelf. Several of the shelves are reserved as a &#x27;rotating collection&#x27; - when the shelf gets full, I make myself sell some books on Amazon before I get new ones. The collection can never exceed the capacity of the one decent-sized bookshelf.Every August, I take an inventory of everything I own and how often I&#x27;m using it. This includes books, clothes, office supplies, everything. Everything gets divided into three categories based on usage: heavily used, not used at all, and marginal. I keep everything in the &#x27;heavily used&#x27; category. I sell, give away, or throw away everything in the &#x27;never used&#x27; category. Then, I make a list of everything in the &#x27;marginal&#x27; category and keep it until the next year. If any given item is still &#x27;marginal&#x27; the next year, I sell it.You&#x27;d be surprised how effective this is. What&#x27;s especially amazing is the crazy stuff you can sell over the net - someone paid 50 bucks for a t-shirt I hadn&#x27;t worn in 15 years. Last year I made enough cash doing this to buy a new Mac. The reduction in clutter is even better.</td>\n",

Rewrite, and you miss an entire development cycle at least - time that could be spent enhancing or adding features.  Stick with what you have, and you have to work with a codebase that makes development a nightmare (otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t consider rewriting).Better to avoid it if possible - do a bit of planning upfront, refactor when you can, have enough tests that refactoring is safe.At my last job we rewrote a large part of the application - but it was done piecemeal, over two years, and never halted development or delayed new features.  Refactoring was \\&quot;snuck in\\&quot; as part of deliverables whenever it was possible and safe.  It was worth it because the new code performed up to 2 orders of magnitude better, and was much easier to work with - but we never would&#x27;ve been able to do it if we simply decided to drop everything and announce that we&#x27;re rewriting the app from scratch.</td>\n",

The existing code just wouldn&#x27;t allow this, even if it were stretched and stretched.So I rewrote most of the codebase.In some ways I was tortured knowing we had a functioning product that already handled things I was rewriting (even though it was on an obsolete platform).  Especially since the rewriting process takes longer than zero.On the other hand, the new set of code turned out smaller, simpler, more reliable, much more flexible, and is now working well as a foundation our for business.Both sides of the argument make sense to me, I think it just depends on the situation.</td>\n",

Unless the company in question has open sourced their code and allows anyone to use it under some kind of a BSD-like license, you have absolutely no right to use that code or IP.Not only are both of these cases illegal, they&#x27;re also highly unethical. Also, if you&#x27;re forming a company around someone else&#x27;s IP, you&#x27;re gonna crash and burn.When I worked as a contractor, I would use my own libraries to save me some time but before I used them, I notified the management that I was using them and told them that I own the code and that I give them full right to use it without any licensing fees and I also told them I would use them on my other contracting jobs. They always accepted these stipulations an I&#x27;ve never had any problems. They loved the fact that I was not wasting my time and their money re-implementing the wheel and that I was solving their problems in record time. The key is to be open and put it all on the table before you start working.Also, after I&#x27;d finish working on a project and if I was using my own computer, I&#x27;d wipe my computer clean of all of their code.

It puts a different spin on doing hard things and I&#x27;ve found it very useful.He said if something is truly hard to do, put it off as long as possible.  But if something is merely distasteful, do it as soon as possible.The rationale is that if something is truly hard to do, you can spend time thinking about it, researching it, gathering resources and asking others about it while doing other necessary things.  Oftentimes, there will be a way to make the hard thing easier or even unnecessary.But if something is more distasteful than hard-to-do, you need to do it right away.  It&#x27;s worse to put off distasteful things than just get them over with.Anyway, that bit of wisdom has worked for me.

See here for a classic example:  http:\\/\\/www.textbookleague.org\\/103feyn.htm  This refers to highschool textbooks but applies equally well, if not more so, to college business texts.It&#x27;s all about the professors.  Business is one of those academic fields, like Paul Graham notes, where the best practitioners are not the educators.  While this is very true as a generalization, there are exceptions -- mainly:  non-practicing educators who happen to be excellent at imparting practical knowledge, and ex-practioners who were once tops in their field.  You will find these professors concentrated in top schools, and you will not find them teaching from these textbooks.  So there is actually quite a lot of value in a business education from a top school.  The well-worn cliche about the value of networking at these institutions applies as well -- and it&#x27;s not just networking in the abstract, it&#x27;s learning how to network with people who can get things done, and getting things done for people who expect big things out of you.  Just like I&#x27;m sure it is in computer science, the value of the education is what you extract from it.\\n</td>\n",

I love hearing about example applications but frankly I don&#x27;t know how much of it I can buy into.Think back 10 years to the examples we were being given about \\&quot;Surfing the Net\\&quot; -- while we have some really cool apps and technology today, things didn&#x27;t turn out quite as people imagined. Technology always has this habit of building alot of hype around potential, but always failing to truly deliver. Additionally the whole concept of the Semantic Web requires that everyone freely exchange their data -- a lovely idea but a bit too romantic if you ask me.My first startup began by squatting in W3C&#x27;s office space, two doors down from TBL. Really, I&#x27;d love nothing more than for it to work but the guys developing the specs for the SW are so out of touch that I wonder if they really have the ability to gain mass adoption.</td>\n",

Particularly the seemingly external factors that turn out to be fundamentals when thinking about economies.  Energy inputs necessary to generate &#x27;wealth&#x27; for example. What population would be necessary to support that level of economic activity.  Keep in mind that the larger your population, the more of your fixed amount of energy resources you will need to do simple support of the population outside of other economic activities.I am somewhat uncertain as to whether this is a misprint, however, I felt compelled to point out that US$6 trillion is an enormous amount of economic activity.  By way of comparison, WalMart&#x27;s revenue is about US$350 billion.  Global telecom market sits somewhere between US$1 trillion and US$3 trillion depending on how we count things.  The energy inputs that go into supporting this economic activity are mind boggling.  Keep in mind that these industries invest a great deal in keeping those energy inputs to a minimum, that is, they invest in &#x27;efficiency&#x27;.  Still the inputs are incredulous!  I suspect energy efficiency is not a strength that Facebook is possessed of.I am fairly confident that this is the point that Warren Buffet would pose a question like will people need more Facebook than food?  Maybe they will.  I just ask that everyone try to keep in mind everything that needs to happen for Facebook to reach those numbers.Then again . . . Maybe he is factoring in the crash of the US Dollar . . .Never mind.</td>\n",

His new venture is doing great.(#1 and #2 are both independently wealthy from previous startups, however.)#3 ended up being hired by the business he tried to compete against.#4 did some consulting work and then took a visiting professorship at a university.#5 slunk back to the cube farm, then was laid off in the next recession and became a househusband.#6 slunk back to the cube farm.Something you should remember: many businesses (particularly ones that don&#x27;t take outside funding) neither succeed nor fail, but limp along with enough revenues to pay a small staff but not enough to grow quickly.  You should be prepared for this possibility and know whether you would want to abandon the startup and go back to the cube farm, or stick it out in hopes of one day making a breakthrough.  For startups that are not in hot markets, you&#x27;ll find that they&#x27;re significantly more work than a regular job with not much more pay (though you do have more freedom).  I know at least 2 other entrepreneurs in this category.As for the best way to manage the possibility of failure: keep your skills sharp, and make sure that you fail because of things you can&#x27;t prevent rather than things you can.  Most big companies will eagerly hire a top-notch hacker who failed because there was no market for what he was building.

I think the blog post we are discussing hits on some good points.  It is possible that we are all right.We need to be honest here and admit, however, that the vast majority of the free to use consumer startups that we are seeing will be challenged generate US$1 Billion in revenue a year. Or for that matter, even US$100 Million.  That is why there is little talk about taking the majority of them public, because other than as a delivery vector for advertisements, there is scarce value in this crop of startups.  To be perfectly frank, these are less than ideal platforms for ad delivery as well.What can be done?  We can try other models, and I&#x27;m sure many will.  There are a boatload of virtual worlds, virtual world platforms, and MMOs coming on line this fall.  ALL of them plan on using ads, microtransactions, and subscriptions.  They are in the good position of being able to use all three of these at the same time, and all of them will.  I predict though that by December all of these companies will have their models DESTROYED by two guys on their couch in boxer shorts developing a FREE virtual world on their laptops while watching SportsCenter and eating ramen.  There will be 1000 college students \\&quot;building portfolios\\&quot; around the country that will make gigabytes of content for the new LINUX of virtual worlds.  It will all be P2P or hosted on Amazon, and it will piss many a VC off.   So the only thing these businesses will have left will be advertising.This is the situation web 2.0 is in.  People keep investing in the hope that some little twist will be the magic one that brings in the most ad bucks.  Charging for these things is not an option, there will be free alternatives if you wait 6 weeks.  Even virtual worlds can be duplicated in 6 weeks these days!  What can we do?It&#x27;s easy to point out the holes in what is currently being done, it is much more difficult to offer a WORKABLE solution.</td>\n",

The argument this time seems to be that the entire industry will crash once it becomes clear that a large site like Facebook can&#x27;t hold on to its ad revenue for more than a few years, because the fickle users can (and supposedly will) migrate to other sites.I don&#x27;t understand. If Facebook&#x27;s users all left the site tomorrow, it would obviously be bad for Facebook, but the rest of the industry would break out the champagne. Users who leave Facebook don&#x27;t abandon the Web and join the Amish - they go someplace else online, and the ad revenue goes right along with them. Friendster&#x27;s collapse was a bad omen for Friendster shareholders, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have had any terrible effect on the rest of the social networking industry, which grew even faster once it absorbed all of Friendster&#x27;s former users.Even if it turns out that individual sites like Facebook are fads, lasting for a few years before burning out, there&#x27;s no reason the industry can&#x27;t adapt. Clothing styles turn over just as quickly as Web fads, but fashion designers still manage to stay in business for decades. You just have to operate at a higher level. The Facebook or YouTube of the future could be a company with half a dozen brands, rolling out (or buying out) a new brand every few years to please the latest group of teenagers. Like a TV network, or Procter and Gamble, or the Pepsi Corporation (which owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell and a substantial piece of your local high school cafeteria.)The real limit to the growth of ad-based sites is the number of users and their available attention - you can only show so many ads to someone in their lifetime. One could argue that the industry is funding, or is about to fund, many more ad-based companies than the ecosystem can support at the moment. But even that would not constitute a \\&quot;bubble\\&quot;. It&#x27;s just the business cycle. These companies aren&#x27;t fantasies or fakes - they&#x27;re just competitors, getting ready to fight for a share of some very real ad dollars.</td>\n",

Basically, the paper&#x27;s thesis was that males are biologically driven to do extraordinary things when young in order to impress females.  For people who have the ability, this can take the form of scientific achievement, or entrepreneurship, or arts or music.  For people who don&#x27;t have the ability to succeed in \\&quot;socially acceptable\\&quot; fields, it usually takes the form of crime.  The age curves themselves look very similar, and they don&#x27;t see similar distributions with females.After a man has children, the odds are significantly lower that he&#x27;ll contribute some world-changing discovery.  This is not because his ability level has decreased - Marc&#x27;s article suggests that quality of work remains constant.  Rather, it&#x27;s because he has no reason to.   He&#x27;s already reproduced, and likely found a lifetime mate.  His children&#x27;s genetic legacy is set in stone.  There&#x27;s no reason for him to expend the extra energy needed to perform at the top of his game.Curiously, men that continue to produce at top-of-the-field levels also seem to have multiple successive wives\\/lovers.  Look at Rudy Giuliani, Richard Feynman, Albert Einstein, Benjamin Graham, etc.  Perhaps they remain geniuses because they see the reproductive game as not over yet, and hope to continue to impress younger, more beautiful women.</td>\n",

Kuhn dissects the idea of the \\&quot;paradigm shift\\&quot; in scientific thinking in the context of classical physics.  It is basically argued that it takes people who aren&#x27;t indoctrinated with the \\&quot;old thinking\\&quot; to come up with the \\&quot;new thinking.\\&quot;  In physics, this usually turns out to be people younger than 26, often through seminal PhD theses.  But not always.  Sometimes people dabble in secondary fields at older ages and come up with significant breakthroughs, like Linus Pauling (http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Linus_Pauling).I&#x27;m not sure what I think about this regarding entrepreneurship.  It seems that very successful entrepreneurs are not always coming up with revolutionary thinking, but instead executing well and paying attention to small details that make things work where they haven&#x27;t before.  As such, the age indoctrination barrier may not be as present as it is in physics.  But of course there are the risk and drive barriers--people get settled and less willing to take risks and go through the arduous process of starting something new later in life.</td>\n",

As some posts have pointed out, we explain our approach in detail on our site:  http:\\/\\/www.tandementrepreneurs.com.  To clarify things a bit more...1.\\tWe&#x27;re not a VC.  We&#x27;re all entrepreneurs and love building businesses.  We put in our sweat first and foremost and happen to invest sufficient capital as well.  We only invest our time and money where we can add value. \\n2.\\tWe offer deep business development and technical skills and an extensive network.  We work as the extended team so the startup can stay small but still have the right quality and quantity of talent.3.\\tWe love the YC approach of supporting entrepreneurs and drew inspiration from their model.  That being said, there are some key differences.  Namely, we get actively involved in each business. We invest funds to carry the company for two years to a potential exit or to a high growth trajectory. And, like YC, we leave open the possibility of a small, early acquisition as exit.  As we all know, this is a likely outcome these days, even though the VCs don&#x27;t like them.4.\\tBecause of our involvement we can get involved with founders whose plans are still nascent, and sometimes we&#x27;ll help put founders together on a business. To us the entrepreneurs are more important than the idea itself.5.\\tWe typically look for technical founders who have a knack for understanding what their users want and then delivering it quickly.  We don&#x27;t encourage outsourcing development unless it&#x27;s just for commodity components of the overall service.6.\\tWe don&#x27;t consider anyone a \\&quot;reject\\&quot; because a fund passed them by.  We&#x27;ll evaluate each team and business on its own merits and go for it if we like the people, think we can add a lot of value, and believe we can build a valuable business together.  Obviously, each group of founders has to decide the same on its side.7.\\tTandem is brand new, but we have a lot of experience at building startups.  We&#x27;ve made two investments thus far and with three principals only plan to do about 6 per year.  In many ways, Tandem is a startup itself in that we&#x27;re breaking the traditional model, having a blast, taking encouragement and support with open arms, and proceeding full steam ahead regardless of what certain \\&quot;established\\&quot; parties in venture finance say.8.\\tWe are happy to entertain folks that have gone through the YC process as well as those that are entering it.  In fact, we&#x27;re attending the YC demo day next week.Best of luck in building your own startups, and we&#x27;d love to hear what you think about Tandem. Feel free to contact us if we can help.\\n</td>\n",

Why did Reddit and Digg descend into their present state?I think something other than \\&quot;the userbase has grown\\&quot; is going on here. I think one major reason is that you see others&#x27; opinions before you decide your own. As a general rule, any Internet poll prompts you to vote before showing you the running results, to attempt to preserve independence of opinion. Reddit and Digg, however, breach this.Secondly, in both Reddit and Digg, any controversial item leaves public sight; only those items that most approve of reach and stay in the front. Those items only of great appeal to a subsection of the user base either fail to reach and stay in the top, and, as a result, simpler items with more general appeal begin to dominate the front.For Reddit; this was the rise of political articles; for Digg, which I am less familiar with, I&#x27;d imagine it involved less technically in-depth items.The above system accelerates; as content begins to represent the cross-section of the interests of a larger, more diverse group, the site attracts an even larger, even more-diverse group.The squashing of controversy and propagation of opinion combine so that commenting maintains a status quo: The posts that are upmodded are known to be upmodded, and, thus newcomers will associate these types of posts with being worthy of upmods and will upmod them themselves. Due to the desire for social status, those newcomers bold enough to begin making comments of their own attempt to imitate the style accepted by the community as \\&quot;upmod-worthy.\\&quot; And thus, newcomers learn to achieve a style that causes their posts to be upmodded.The above two points combine: The oldtimers tolerated newcomers; the newcomers tolerated newer-comers; due to the logistical nature of the system, each \\&quot;generation\\&quot; outnumbers the previous. The newer-comers whom the oldtimers indirectly \\&quot;let in\\&quot; may create comments repulsive to many of the oldtimers that get upmodded to the top; this slowly disillusions the relevant oldtimers, causing them to leave, solidifying the community&#x27;s shift.And there, that&#x27;s Digg, according to my understanding. I must admit I&#x27;ve used Digg little and do not have a firm grasp on how its system works, so everything I say about Digg should be taken with a grain of salt; on Reddit, I am more confident in my ability to speak truthfully.Reddit&#x27;s story goes further: In Reddit, a controversial item where one side has an advantage can reach the front page. Thus, assuming it involves the general cross section of readers, the ideology that originally had an upper hand will get its content to the front and the opposing ideologues, primarily reading items they disagree with, leave. The former ideology solidifies its hold; future opponents of said ideology get discouraged from joining; groupthink evolves.And thus, my theory for the state of Reddit today. Reddit&#x27;s original techie audience created the status quo of commenting style. They drew in their friends and peers from various communities via word of mouth. The new users tolerated and contributed to the technical articles that were reddit&#x27;s genesis; the techies tolerated and contributed to the nontechnical articles being brought in. The cycle occurred again, and, though the technical bias in the community was preserved through visible, active posters, a shift toward articles with broader appeal was well underway.  Since the original techie user base likely contained more liberals and libertarians than conservatives, the former two  ideologies, both of which involve laypeople and can be associated with most topics, began to heavily get their content into the front. Liberalism and libertarianism tolerate each other somewhat, but liberalism was stronger due to its numerical advantage among the general populace. The hold of liberalism expanded as outlined.As one might expect from the above paragraph, the front page of the Reddit of today has articles on healthcare, global warming, and other politicized material; some items supporting Ron Paul; and a whole bunch of items with broad but shallow appeal, such as pictures of cats.</td>\n",

But I&#x27;ll take a stab. I&#x27;ll skip 2 because I don&#x27;t watch so much TV, reason being that in most cases, reading is the fastest way of absorbing information.1. of course they are meaningful, because I know the people. The ties they create are digital. For those that bond with their friends online, FB facilitates it. For those that don&#x27;t there&#x27;s no difference (I&#x27;m in this group). I don&#x27;t expose much of myself nor edit my profile much because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the effort.3. This problem I&#x27;m particularly interested in.\\nThe idea that services like these attract the LCD is a result of their design and not of operation. I think it is possible to circumvent this problem, but you must change the design concept.I recently attended the Wikimania conference and they talked about the absurd complexity of the rules now applied to Wikipedia. The oldies were talking about \\&quot;back in the day\\&quot; just like the old diggers. Spawning a new Wikipedia-like system isn&#x27;t going to work; Citizendium is not the answer. You can spawn a new digg and it would still face the same problems. You can talk about spawning a new news.yc for non-startup content, and assuming it gets popular, it would still run into quality control problems. Plus, pg has a sizeable following, but there is only one of him: unless he clones himself for the new site, or creates a different system, his divested energy will result in one being less active than the other.A community news site that handles 10K users isn&#x27;t going to handle 1M users similarly just by scaling the system or by implementing friends and leaders. There&#x27;s that rule of 150 written in the Tipping Point book that says any group exceeding about 150 members will become difficult to manage(I shouldn&#x27;t cite Gladwell but it&#x27;s not an unfounded idea). A site of thousands of active members will, of course, run into management problems, but with a 10:90 active:lurker ratio, it works ok when your site has up to perhaps 20k users before you see any substantial, visible change in focus. Since not every user is active at the same time of day, you can increase the size of the virtual community, perhaps to something like 300 core members before the content changes dramatically.I don&#x27;t know digg&#x27;s numbers, but taking wikipedia as an example, with thousands of active editors, of course you will run into problems! And they think it&#x27;s a result of lack of consensus over what is acceptible behavior or something.Seems pretty obvious to me, and I welcome challengers. When I said this at the conference nobody seemed to buy it though.</td>\n",

It does strengthen my existing friendships, and I&#x27;ve made some new friends on there as well. With the new apps coming out, it seems like the sky is the limit. The only thing I dislike about it is the design - it is very usable, which is priority #1, but otherwise so-so. I especially hate the offset-header thing they do, it makes me feel as if something is missing\\/broken. Many of the apps are counterintuitive or obnoxious. I hope people aren&#x27;t getting mad at me for ignoring their zombie invitations.2. There is a lot of weakness here, which seems odd considering the obviousness of the solution: I should be able to watch any TV show from any network I want, whenever I want. I should be able to pay 50 cents to get rid of the ads or something, or just run the ads outside of the shows entirely. In addition, when I go to a network site the landing page should be a video player playing whatever is being broadcast in my time zone at that moment. 1) Put TV on the internet. How hard can that be? 2) Make it random-access. 3) Have all the shows on there, past and present.3. Online news is even weaker than online TV, if that&#x27;s possible. I&#x27;d rather bathe in motor oil than read the comments on Digg or Newsvine. There does seem to be a correlation between how long a news site has been around and how badly it sucks. Could a million bored secretaries flaming randomly eventually reproduce the works of Shakespeare? I don&#x27;t know, but they&#x27;re giving it their best shot.I&#x27;m going to say something heretical here: social news is a lousy idea unless a narrow focus is maintained, like news.yc. I read news looking for insights that I as an average American cannot reach on my own. The commentary of millions of other average Americans adds NOTHING - in fact, it&#x27;s a negative value proposition. The solution, if you agree with me that news should provide insight, is exceptional reporting, top-notch writing, and a variety of ideological viewpoints. You aren&#x27;t going to get that stuff from the internet masses.That being said, I do like very focused social news sites like news.yc.

Oxycontin is pretty much taboo after the enormous settlement they paid. There&#x27;s always money in the legal drugs business. The patent holder for formulations of 7-hydroxy-mitragynine would need to be much more responsible about marketing than the Oxycontin suppliers. Mitragynine alkaloids are atypical opiates that are less addictive than the opiates in the poppy plant.7-hydroxy-mitragynine is the main active alkaloid in kratom, but kratom is not currently approved for sale as a drug or supplement in America.

Basically, from what I have read \\/ researched \\/ been told by people who-know-what-they-are-talking-about, competition in this field is actually a good sign:1. It means that someone else has decided your product\\/service is worthwhile enough to actually spend the time and energy to develop it. &#x27;No competition&#x27; is very often a good indicator of &#x27;Bad idea&#x27; or &#x27;No market.&#x27;2.

There is plenty of room for companies with competing services, especially if their products are marked by substantially different features and\\/or payment methods (or lack thereof).3. Motivation: if I found out tomorrow that a YC company was doing exactly what I was doing, I would probably sleep less and try to get my product to market faster. Currently, there are a few competitors, but their services are either targed outside my demo or are, well, crappy. It is precisely the lack of the service that I am trying to provide that is my main motivation for working to bring it to market: I want to use it! Competition would validate that other people are thinking like me, and would also go a long way -- by using their product -- of understanding exactly what it is I am getting myself into.</td>\n",

Perl, Python, Java, Visual Basic... Applesoft Basic?  Are you going to use a framework or code everything from scratch?These answers are all important, but it is possible to do a good job or a bad job with any of those languages.  Ultimately the choice of platform, languages, database, etc. are not as important as how you put the pieces together.You might also what other successful sites are using, particularly those with data structures similar to what you are planning.  I believe Facebook and Wikipedia both use PHP and MySQL.  FlightAware (which does a really super job with lots of real-time data) uses Postgres.While it is, I&#x27;m sure, possible to design a very effective site with almost any combination but Windows\\/.Net\\/MSSQL seems like a particularly poor choice.  There are only a few  big data-driven sites using that technology and most of them aren&#x27;t technically very good.  Myspace is one example - (I think they use MSSQL) - but they have horrible response times and frequent hiccups.  Ancestry.com is another big .Net site but they have a lot of problems.  Pages frequently hang while loading, response not quick at all and their UI is very awkward.  Several of the big airline sites run .Net but they aren&#x27;t very good either.  Big companies whose primary business isn&#x27;t IT seem to go with .Net a lot and it shows in the quality of their sites - but that&#x27;s not so bad - it creates a lot of opportunities for people like us.  While I&#x27;m sure it is POSSIBLE to do good work on the Microsoft platform it seems very, very unlikely.My personal choice after having worked, at one time or another, with all of the options discussed here is very clearly LAMP - Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl|PHP|Python but I wouldn&#x27;t object to substituting BSD, Lighttpd or Postgres.As someone around here said recently, \\&quot;...anyone proposing to run Windows on servers should be prepared to explain what they know about servers that Google, Yahoo, and Amazon don&#x27;t.\\&quot;</td>\n",

Furthermore, it makes long-term legal costs lower because most corporate lawyers are familiar with Delaware&#x27;s nuances.All corporations are C by default.  You have to file a special from with the IRS to become an S Corporation.  S Corporations are flow-through entities which are not taxed at the corporate level.  The reason VCs require you to be a C Corporation is two-fold:1. VCs like to have unilateral rights and terms to give them downside protection such as liquidity preference and preferential stock classes such as Preferred Shares.  S Corporations are simpler entities which only allow a maximum of 40 shareholders - as your company grows and you give stock grants or options, this won&#x27;t work.  LLCs only allow 75 shareholders.  2. VCs will claim that a C Corp structure gives you more flexibility.  This is marginally true, but LLCs give you the same flexibility with slightly higher administrative cost but you can maintain the flow-through status which is advantageous.The real reason is they want preferred shares and special rights.  Stay an LLC or S Corporation if you don&#x27;t need institutional investors.  Angels are happy to invest in well structured LLCs or standard subchapter S Corporations.</td>\n",

At all. It never has, and it never will. Those photos you took are pointless. If pictures are worth a thousand words, then people are worth a billion photos. A few photos a day just can&#x27;t capture what you&#x27;re thinking, the social context, the general mood, your thoughts and feelings, the state of the economy, foreign relations, what you just did 5 minutes prior, what you just ate, what your friends are up to off-camera, if the person next to you smells like they&#x27;re drunk, the charge on your cell phone, your status with friends and family, etc.Photos give the illusion of defining you at a point in time, but they are NOT a virtual machine or an environment like Squeak--they&#x27;re just a screen shot--and not what the person&#x27;s doing, either, but what what&#x27;s visible for that split second of time.The big problem, then, is that people judge themselves by what they would look like if somebody were to take a photo of them, and not by where they&#x27;re going. In fact, people are doing everything they can to impede where they&#x27;re going--buying anti-age cremes, spending money so they don&#x27;t have to take the responsibility of saving it, which might otherwise make them feel older. So, people are always focusing on looking like they have never made any progress in their lives.However, when traveling through life--whether by car, aging, networking, degrees, promotions, dating)--it doesn&#x27;t matter where you actually are. At all. It never has, and it never will.The only two things that matter are the direction and velocity. Therefore, you always have to make the best choices you can for your life, when buying things, socializing, and business. Look at what&#x27;s stopping you, decide your options, and pick the best overall choice, and if you really can&#x27;t see a better way, then do the option that is easier. Then move on. Life is better than any video game because you have infinite choices in infinite areas. The key is to hurry up and make a choice, and move on to the other 230 trillion choices you have.If you know you like a shirt, and the fit and price range is good, but you can&#x27;t decide between red and blue, pick one randomly and move on.

The direction you should take your career will become more obvious after you do that.  In my experience, these are the biggest obstacles to loving what you do:- Being pessimistic yourself.- Being surrounded by pessimistic people.- Working for pessimistic management.- Dealing with a poor physical work environment.- Forgetting to aggressively attempt hard problems.Sometimes, you&#x27;ll hit a wall.  It can&#x27;t ALL come from within (though some Bhuddists may disagree).  I unloaded trucks in a warehouse for a few months after college, and while it was rewarding to get stronger and satisfying to work very quickly, it was clear that there would be very little change approaching infinity, and I could not do this the rest of my life.  In my last job, I was beginning to notice a similar wall, but more importantly it was fairly clear that management both did not enjoy working with technology, and did not enjoy managing employees within the framework of the company.  They did not enjoy dealing with bureaucracy, yet it was forced on them often.  This resulted in consistently poor morale.  Even when we thought morale was good, it was bad by the standards of the company I work fow now.  It happened so gradually that all of a sudden one day I noticed that the thought of going to work made me sick to me stomach.  But I knew it wasn&#x27;t the work, because just a month or so earlier I&#x27;d happily immersed myself in a project and learned a lot, and I&#x27;d been making consistent progress.  If you need inspiration, Paul Graham&#x27;s essays are good, although the one I would recommend first is Fred Brooks \\&quot;The Tar Pit\\&quot; (part of The Mythical Man-Month collection).  In particular, in the section called \\&quot;Joys of the Craft\\&quot; he lists five reasons:  The joy of making things, the pleasure of making them for other people, the fascination of the puzzle-like nature of the problems, the joy of always learning, and the delight of working in such a \\&quot;tractible medium\\&quot; that nevertheless produces real measurable results.  </td>\n",

But as far as I&#x27;m concerned a job is just a tool, a (rather painful) way to obtain freedom; the wealth I create while working allows me to do whatever I want in my free time (I&#x27;d rather have just the wealth than the job). I prefer clearly separating my work life and my fun life instead of living for my job. The non-work part is much easier: if I want to become a robotics engineer for a month, I can buy parts and play with them until I get bored (and want to become a musician for a month). If I want to become a professional robotics engineer, it&#x27;s a very different story! (I chose this example while thinking of Anybots: now that Trevor has the wealth, I&#x27;m pretty sure he&#x27;s building robots for pure fun only; if he decided early, right after graduation, to start a career in robotics he would probably be designing boring industrial robots for some corporation).</td>\n",

              "            <td>OK, here is some of the \\&quot;why\\&quot; of facebook for those of us who aren&#x27;t heavy users.Facebook is casual and useful. It&#x27;s easy to set up an event or fundraiser, invite everyone you know, put up pictures about the event, and so on. Many comments show that there are expectations for use cases that Facebook really isn&#x27;t about. \\&quot;Having hundreds of &#x27;friends&#x27; is pointless.\\&quot; \\&quot;...looking for dates...met someone interesting...\\&quot; That&#x27;s not what Facebook is about, nor intended to be.Yep, you can stay in touch with your close friends on Facebook if you really want. Many people do. But, it&#x27;s really about those hundreds of people you still care about, but you don&#x27;t see on a regular basis. It is the best way to keep tabs on them. It&#x27;s also great for setting plans with them. As a personal side note, Facebook has led to several happy reunions with old friends after I lost their contact information for years.More about the idea of \\&quot;Facebook is casual\\&quot;. Facebook messages have injected themselves between email and IM on the formality spectrum, and wall posts are now between Messages and IM. You can initiate conversation with people who would otherwise find it odd. Like, say, members of the attractive sex. The common theme is that Facebook pleases our in-born psychological social instincts. It is a fine lesson in human factors. Yet more. The cool kids are on facebook. You know, the ones that we&#x27;re supposed to hate as self-respecting geeks, because we&#x27;re smarter but they somehow have more fun? That means people who care about being cool get on Facebook. (Although rebellion is cool, so now it&#x27;s cool to take a stand against Facebook and stay off. But that&#x27;s a whole other story.)It&#x27;s a perfectly acceptable social norm to \\&quot;Facebook-stalk\\&quot; someone: To look up their interests when you&#x27;re interested in them. That&#x27;s a big one. It&#x27;s a handy, casual way of passing around contact information. Once you know someone&#x27;s name and a little bit about them, you can find them on Facebook. You don&#x27;t need to ask for their phone number or IM or email address, find somewhere to write it down, and take 30 awkward seconds to do it. You just say, \\&quot;Let&#x27;s find each other on Facebook.\\&quot; To be clear: Facebook makes it just a little bit easier to pick up. Also, friending is a no-cost way of sending goodwill.So that&#x27;s why people use Facebook.People on this discussion board love news about Facebook because Facebook is every tech entrepreneur&#x27;s wet dream. Zuckerberg is young, modest, smart and very, very rich. Startup founders love to dream about Facebook-like success because that&#x27;s what they all want. It&#x27;s intellectual masturbation. When someone posts insights about Facebook&#x27;s success, instant nerdgasm. Also, Facebook is an important enough influence on mainstream digital life that few Web entrepreneurs can ignore it. Facebook app clones can kill fledgling independent applications fast. And if Facebook manages to get people used to spending money while on Facebook, they could rival Google, Amazon, and Ebay in importance. Finally, a note about the &#x27;stolen idea&#x27;. Let&#x27;s ignore that where the idea came from is irrelevant to Facebook&#x27;s current utility and success. You ought to realize that ideas are near-worthless and execution is everything. FB is a case study in excellent execution. They hire brilliant developers just like Joel says, and they built a very clean UI as a competitive advantage over Myspace. Nearly all successful businesses are based on incremental improvements on existing ideas with great execution. Put it this way: \\&quot;Online store\\&quot; is not terribly creative, but pg is rich and famous today because his gang of hackers had the best execution in building one. Search engines were not a new idea when Google took over the world. Nor were operating systems or word processors when Microsoft did before that. Online social networks were not new. They just sucked enough that there was room for Facebook to step in a build a better one.\\n</td>\n",

Once I finally got to the site, I still didn&#x27;t know what it was, but I recognized that it was some sort of search engine, so I typed in a search for a bookstore I like and got one result - a person who said they liked something or other which happened to use the same word as the bookstore&#x27;s name.

It was a consumer impulse buy and so we tried to keep the price down for that reason.  When we got enough size, we ran statistical tests to figure out the best price point in terms of maximization of profits.I also have had experience selling an online book.

Unfortunately, you&#x27;ve got a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem: there are currently no groups or events in my zip code (Boston), which means I&#x27;m not likely to visit the site regularly.  I know that others will have the same reticence towards regular visits, so when I have an event or group, I&#x27;m more likely to post it where people are actually watching.  I know that group starters will reason that way, and so I have no reason to keep visiting the site.  And so on.  It&#x27;s all game theory.You&#x27;ve gotta break the cycle somehow and make this useful to small groups of people that are already in close contact with each other.  Maybe you can convince people to organize the next news.YC meetup on it.  Or maybe you can feature in some sort of asynchronous time-shifting: let people indicate their interests now, and then as groups and events appear, give them notification.A couple specific comments\\/suggestions:I like the design of the site.  Clean, minimalist, and directs you to things you can do with it.It&#x27;s really nifty that you go straight from search results to a \\&quot;get new results by RSS\\&quot; link.  But add an e-mail option too!  It may seem hard to believe, but not everybody uses RSS, particularly outside of tech circles.  Keep the UI simple - just have someone enter an e-mail address and it&#x27;ll email you when a new group appears in your location.It&#x27;d be nice to be able to filter searches\\/subscriptions by keyword as well.  For example, I&#x27;m interested in startup &amp;#38; programming groups in Boston.  I&#x27;d like to be able to say \\&quot;Show me all the startup organizations in Boston\\&quot;, and if there are none, I want to be able to type in my e-mail address, get notified when new ones appear, and otherwise forget about the site.If you do this, you might want to show off popular subscriptions (location + keywords) on the front page.  Aside from indicating that people are listening for new groups, it also could show people what interests are hottest.  This could be a good signal for which groups people may want to start.I personally would not care all that much about message boards, at least not until the site gets a lot of traffic.  Then it&#x27;d be nifty, but not essential.Rename the Help link to Help\\/Feedback or Help\\/Contact or just Contact to indicate that you&#x27;re receptive to suggestions.</td>\n",

Any simulated brain won&#x27;t be able to tell, because it doesn&#x27;t get any updates in between these steps.  Time becomes a property of the system you&#x27;re simulating...  Just like in reality.  It might take until the Sun goes Red Giant to run your single lifetime simulation.The speed of light is a convenience for updating the simulation in discrete steps.  Particle\\/wave duality \\&quot;deciding\\&quot; upon observation is just lazy evaluation, like in Haskell.  Quantum entanglement is no mystery when distance is virtual.  A Universe where the speed of light is a hard limit can still contain a simulated Universe where it isn&#x27;t.Why do we want virtual worlds?  Properly implemented and convincing, we can do away with suffering altogether.  We can \\&quot;live\\&quot; in a world that seems fully real, but in which no-one is actually suffering because everyone else is simulated.  All our needs are met and all our desires are fulfilled.The mistake we keep making is that in order to create convincing AIs to inhabit the world with us, they actually become as sentient and conscious as we are; being virtual is no barrier to feelings or emotions!  [1]Thus our creations want to create a simulation to live in themselves, so they won&#x27;t suffer, either, and so it goes like a perpetual zoom on a fractal set.[1] To convince yourself of this, consider a matter replicator that copies every single atom in your body.  You&#x27;d create a clone.  It would be thinking and feeling just as you do.  Now consider a computer simulation of a single atom; if that can be done, then by extension, it would be possible to simulate anything made of atoms.  A simulated clone of you would also behave the same.  The neurological activity that occurs in your \\&quot;real\\&quot; brain when you feel or think would also occur across the virtual atoms in the brain of your virtual clone.  In fact, that would involve real electrical activity taking place among real atoms making up the RAM chips and CPUs \\&quot;containing\\&quot; the simulation of the virtual clone.  Thus any simulation at the same scope or nesting level as yourself is as real as you are and therefore its feelings are just as valid. [2][2] By further extension, if your simulations are as real as you are, then your simulation&#x27;s simulations are as real as it is, and thus a simulation at any nesting level is as real as one at any other -- a simulation inside a simulation is still running on real atoms with real electricity!\\n</td>\n",

We simulate reality when we&#x27;re getting ready for the day and deciding what to wear. Or when our stomach rumbles for lunch and we mentally compare General Tso&#x27;s finest masterpiece against the toasty cheese of Quizno&#x27;s. Indeed, I&#x27;d argue that the human brain is at it&#x27;s best as a simulation engine - predicting the future and understanding the present based on past experiencesDon&#x27;t fall for the 90% myth. We can&#x27;t be sure where it came from, but it simply isn&#x27;t true. The brain is a simple organ only in the sense that if you don&#x27;t use it, you lose it. Consider: You were born with 10x the number of cells you end up needing. The ones that survived are ones that found connections and strengthened them with their neighbors.Indeed, that&#x27;s what makes \\&quot;mind transplants\\&quot; so difficult to pull off.

She doesn&#x27;t believe in evolution.There are quotas for minorities. Many otherwise qualified students are denied acceptance because their places are reserved. And not just a few... many.Logistically, kids need to be bused from other schools, but transportation is uncooperative and the schools resent the hassle. There is also an additional bureaucratic and testing cost. These costs are in addition to running the programs themselves, but _these_ costs specifically antagonize other political entities in the school district.And of course... unlike special ed, teachers resent busing away their best students. They fight over dumping the worst, of course.Politically (within the district) gifted education is a career for pariahs. They create hassle for the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; (aka \\&quot;real\\&quot;) teachers and they have no power to deter neglect or abuse. The teachers and staff in the department are paid less than require more education than \\&quot;real\\&quot; teachers. This drives away the best teaching talent and firmly entrenches the some least ambitious teachers within the department. The curriculum is a petri dish of all sorts of inane pet political agendas. Especially in science and math, the teachers don&#x27;t know the subjects themselves, so these subjects simply aren&#x27;t taught beyond a pre-packaged lesson plan.The consequence: the most qualified students leave the district (if they can.) Instead of integration, communities become more and more segregated. Fact is, if you don&#x27;t \\&quot;segregate\\&quot; special resources for the best within a community, the best will leave. School districts only have incentives to reduce segregation with their local district. But segregation is inevitable, and failing to deal with it merely bubbles the segregation to higher levels.Hence, I&#x27;m writing this from Silicon Valley and not the midwest.UpdateSo nerd education is the nerd of education.

              "            <td>This is true, and an astute observation.  It&#x27;s also unavoidable - or at least one of the better alternatives.Everybody has their own ideas of how things should be.  In a society of 300 million people, that means 300 million different ideas.  There will be some overlap, but obviously they won&#x27;t all think the same things - then they&#x27;d really be brainwashed.Unfortunately, there&#x27;s only one way that things actually are.  So somehow you&#x27;ve got to condense the myriad of different cultures, beliefs and desires into a single reality.  Governments have relied on various ways of accomplishing this:1.) Kill everyone who doesn&#x27;t agree with the \\&quot;official\\&quot; culture.  Eg. Rwanda, Bosnia, Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany, U.S. conquest of Native Americans2.) Kill the most vocal proponents of alternate viewpoints, enough to terrorize the remaining citizens into keeping with the party line.  Eg. modern Russia, several South American governments, apartheid South Africa3.) Convince the population that eternal damnation awaits anyone who disagrees with the party line.  Eg. the Catholic Church4.) Split the population into many little populations, each of which can have their own reality.  Eg. former Yugoslavia, former Soviet Union, American Civil War, Roman Empire.  Problem with this is that each sub-state still wants to impose its reality upon its neighbors, so you often get continual warfare until one gobbles up the others.5.) Convince a majority of the population that they really agree with you.  This is the \\&quot;discrimination and brainwashing\\&quot; you refer to.6.) Develop some fundamental principles that everybody agrees on, then agree to disagree on the specifics, knowing that eventually reality will come swing your way.  Eg. the Enlightenment theory behind liberty and democracy#6 seems to be the ideal, but it requires some cognitive dissonance, namely the ability to say \\&quot;I disagree with what you&#x27;re doing, but will defend your right to do it.\\&quot;  Most people are not capable of this kind of cognitive dissonance - either they slip into \\&quot;I will not defend your right to do this\\&quot; and end up with #1 or #2, or they slip into \\&quot;I agree with what you&#x27;re doing\\&quot; and end up with #5.So #5 is the most stable system that a large civilization can enter.  Most Western democracies actually function as a combination of #5 and #6, with the masses adjusting their beliefs to fit their leaders and the leaders themselves agreeing to disagree under fundamental principles.  U.S. democracy is currently in danger because a disturbing number of \\&quot;leaders\\&quot; (on both sides) are suggesting #1 or #3, but the political party system is meant to encourage #6.Incidentally, the same problem happens with multi-party governments.  Most multi-party systems are actually run by coalitions, where a bunch of parties get together and say \\&quot;Okay, I don&#x27;t totally agree with all of your viewpoints, but for the sake of getting things done I&#x27;ll let you do things your way.\\&quot;</td>\n",

It has to do with more with how the US government is set up and less with the psychology of its people.  There are other countries with different setups that are not two-party dominant.  One viable way out of such dominance is some form of party-list proportional representation (see http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Party-list_proportional_represe...) .The second is all about psychology, it most certainly has several components at play.  I posit the most prevalent are attitudes of commitment given the initial choice of party and some form of path of least resistance.The former is common in psychology.  It is a natural instinct to think your group is better as soon as you join it, for whatever reason, even an arbitrary one.  This even happens in psychology experiments when groups are assigned randomly.  The latter reason is simply most people don&#x27;t research any issues nor do they want to.  They go with perhaps the simplest method to decide, which is listen to what the group told me before.  There is some real trade-off here.  To be fully informed is perhaps impossible.  You need some sort of proxy for most policy issues.  Blindly following one of two major parties (on the other extreme) is probably not the answer either of course.</td>\n",

With the right kind of backstabbing, Nazis or Bolzhevics can wipe out their allies from within and seize control. Just not possible in the US...In the US&#x27;s winner-take-all system, the parties themselves must compromise on their plaform, and generally aim for about 50.1 percent of the vote--they&#x27;d rather 60 percent of gun-lovers than 100 percent, because the latter is unpalatable to the rest of their members.

I think I&#x27;ll manage to piss off both the Austrian school mises.org Libertarians and the I-always-get-screwed-by-corporations Liberals.Free markets work when they transmit information with each transaction.  When a factory owner raises his prices to cover rising costs, he&#x27;s encapsulating information about everything that&#x27;s happened further up the value chain.  When a shopkeeper lowers the price he&#x27;s willing to pay, he&#x27;s encapsulating information about consumer demand and everything downstream in the value chain.  If a new means of production becomes available that&#x27;s more efficient than the old one, there&#x27;s a profit opportunity available for the aspiring entrepreneur.  And everybody has an incentive to pass on correct information, because otherwise it&#x27;s their own bank account that will suffer.  This appears to be the only way to organize an economy efficiently.Free markets fail when transactions conceal information.  For example, many subprime loans were made to people who had no conceivable way of paying them off, but mortgage brokers had every incentive to hide that information from the hedge funds who bought them, and didn&#x27;t have to shoulder the risk of default themselves.  Health-care patients have no way of knowing whether a particular procedure is medically necessary and no incentive to find out, because the insurance company pays for it.  Microsoft customers had no way of knowing whether Windows is the best OS, because there were no alternatives (well, except Apple and Linux...pretend this is 1997 or so).There&#x27;s also the issue of transaction costs - it costs nearly as much money to collect tolls as it does to just build the damn highway, so the \\&quot;information\\&quot; that the customer sees is heavily distorted by the process of having to collect that information.So, based on this, I can derive some general principles for the role of government:1.) It should provide the institutional framework necessary for the market to function at all, eg. contract laws and defense.2.) It should rectify the \\&quot;lemon problem\\&quot;, where sellers conceal vital information from buyers or vice-versa, eg. consumer protection laws, implied warranties, truth-in-advertising laws, full disclosure on mortgages, SEC regulation, etc.3.) It should prevent companies from leveraging a monopoly to enter a market.4.) It should rectify externalities, where a firm takes something of value to others but doesn&#x27;t pay for it, usually because it&#x27;s too difficult to arrange a transaction.  The classic example is pollution.5.) It should provide goods and services where the transaction cost of attempting to measure and restrict usage is greater than the actual value of the service.  Markets will never develop in these areas otherwise.  A good example would be roads.Some concrete examples, which&#x27;ll probably seem kinda out-there:To start, I wouldn&#x27;t have any taxes at all.  Instead, the government owns all land, and raises revenue by auctioning off leases on land, natural resources, and pollution credits.  These leases would be tradable, subdividable securities, and would be subject to normal SEC prohibitions on disclosure and insider trading.  If you wanted to construct a skyscraper that you expect to last 50 years, you&#x27;d buy a 50-year lease on the land.  If you ended up selling it after 20, you could sell the lease on the open market, but the land itself would revert back to the government after another 30 years.  The government can also buy the lease back by paying market rates.This helps the externality problem, because every time the voters want to prevent something like a polluting factory, they have the legal ability to, but they also have a precise dollar figure for how much it&#x27;ll cost, in economic terms.  If people don&#x27;t want oil companies to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, they can simply block the lease on drilling rights, but it will cost them a few billion dollars.  Then they can decide whether the economic value to oil companies is worth more than the government services they will receive from it.As for spending itself - roads are an obvious one, because the transaction costs of tolls are hellish.  Defense is another one - I don&#x27;t think we need to spend quite so much as we do, but we do need a strong military.I would not provide free education, other than the basic literacy and civic requirements necessary for democracy to function.  You tend to get what you pay for.  Free education not only leads to bureacratic, uncaring schoolboards, but it also leads to freeriding, uncaring schoolchildren.  Instead, I&#x27;d create rigorous public evaluations of all schools - not necessarily tests (which generally reflect the politicians&#x27; biases more than actually useful information), but statistics about where graduates end up, satisfaction levels, evaluations from past students, etc.  Then let people choose - and spend their own money - on schools.  Since people shouldn&#x27;t be denied education based on what their parents do, there should be loans available - but through the private sector, not public.  Also, education has a problem in that it takes years for it to pay off, and market conditions can change dramatically between when you enter and when you exit.  To insure against this, I&#x27;d create a tradable derivative called \\&quot;salary futures\\&quot; (again through the private sector).  This is not insurance on your salary (that would have a huge moral hazard problem), but rather a promise to pay the change in the difference between the average salaries of two professions.  These can be bundled into funds if necessary, to diversify across the whole economy.  So if you want to become an engineer but find that salaries have gone way down by the time you graduate, your salary future will kick in with the difference for X number of years, and then you can decide whether to stick with it or retrain as a lawyer.Health care is tricky because nobody wants to die, and if life really is priceless, then people should be willing to pay infinite amounts of money to avoid dying.  Markets aren&#x27;t meant to deal with infinities. I&#x27;d need to think about this; I suppose if I actually came up with a workable solution I&#x27;d be rich and famous and wouldn&#x27;t be posting it on a glorified message board. ;-)</td>\n",

There is much regulation, and the current model of requiring corporations give their employees health insurance is flawed. Contrarywise, prices have fallen in cosmetic surgery, the only medical field mostly left to the free market.(And where did you get the entire that free education means government education? There have been free schools in America since before there was a country called \\&quot;America.\\&quot;)Second of all, an economically free society would likely have taxes nowhere near 25%. That&#x27;s higher than Hong Kong&#x27;s income tax today, and much higher than America&#x27;s income tax when income tax was legalized.I&#x27;ve decided that the bare minimum of government that must be had are the courts (and the power to enforce their rulings). A libertarian society will be highly dependent on contracts; society could not function if you knew a powerful client could refuse to pay and ignore court rulings. I have trouble visualizing a fair, for-profit court system. If competing court systems exist, then how is the court system for a case chosen? Presumably, it would be spelled out in the contract, which gives a perpetual advantage to the vendor. Of course, the buyer could ignore the summons, but said court could force him to arrive and would then rule that it was justified doing so (as it was).Everything that is not a court can belong to the free market, but that does not mean should. For example, you could purchase the privilege to drive on one company&#x27;s network of roads, but, barring some major advances in scanning technology and some means of stopping trespassers,  the need to enforce that only paid cars use the road would be extraordinarily cumbersome. The best private road system I could see would be to have a monopoly on roads in every region; road companies could then make deals with neighbors for interregional traffic and coerce developments into requiring residents to pay the road company, at the risk of having the road company block access to the development. However, I&#x27;m not sure I can trust a private monopoly more than a government monopoly.Law enforcement is also a good candidate for government control; however, private police forces are not out of the question. There would probably be less overhead to hire police to protect an area rather than individuals, so police might not necessarily turn a blind eye to a homeless man getting mugged (not to mention that said criminal should be caught for the same reason Animal Control kills animals becoming accustomed to attacking humans). However, a system where every five feet is patrolled by a police force with different opinions of what an arrestable offense is is hardly ideal.Fire protection, another commonly cited candidate for government control, could actually work pretty well privately. A computer can easily check whether a certain building is protected, and the benefits of competition will result. However, one problem is that a fire on an unprotected building endangers adjacent buildings.</td>\n",

Maybe you&#x27;d work on the networking stack, providing services that made transferring between connections as seamless as possible (hopping from public wi-fi to 3G to WiMax, and prioritizing traffic based on network bandwidth and costs).  Maybe we change filesystems to better support synchronization - for example, build in better change tracking so that we can synchronize using the minimum amount of bandwidth.  Maybe you&#x27;d look for ways to be able to transfer the state of your applications, so you can work on one machine, and then continue working on your phone, then on your hotel TV, then back to the original machine.  What about collaboration and communication?  How can we build applications that seamlessly combine web information with local information (maybe even blurring the difference)?  Not everything belongs in the OS, but the supporting functionality certainly does.None of these ideas are particularly new, but today&#x27;s software stack is in need of some pretty serious evolution to get the most out of the promise of a connected world.

My real problem with the talk is that isn&#x27;t testable - it makes an observation, then goes back into the facts to justify it.  I&#x27;m not seeing enough of the hypothesis-testing approach that is the cornerstone of real science.I don&#x27;t want to seem like I&#x27;m being too hard on the guy.  After all, some questions just can&#x27;t be approached this way.  We can measure the effectiveness of a new drug on blood pressure through hypothesis and testing, but it would be very difficult, maybe impossible, to use this approach to determine why the first world war was fought.  Sometimes you just have to go back through the facts and construct a plausable case.  But it isn&#x27;t science anymore.Aside from that, I agree (for what it&#x27;s worth) with much of what he has to say, but I still think he has understated the degree of exclusion women have experienced from male networks.  It&#x27;s really damaging.Suppose that it&#x27;s true, as the author stated, that men are more likely than women to be wired for risk.  Sounds reasonable enough.  But that might still mean that for every 5 people with the ability and inclination do do something risky (say, found a startup), 4 are male and one is female.  But the way males form networks often excludes the women - even in the modern day.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s on purpose, and there&#x27;s rarely any malice, but it&#x27;s just as damaging.  You generally pick friends for your startup.  The people you get drunk with, stay up all night completing the compiler class with, cram into a hotel room in vegas with... and you tend to do these things with close friends who are almost always other guys.  If 4\\/5 are guys, then the odds that a man will find like-minded buddies is much higher than it is for women.  I double majored in Math and English.  It was a trip.  I&#x27;d count the ratio of men to women in each class, and it was usuall between 5:1 and 10:1.  And in the math class (sorry to say it), many of the women were planning on becoming math teachers.  This means that the women with the ability and inclination to do startups have to break into the boys club or they&#x27;ll be left in the cold.  So far, they&#x27;re usually left in the cold.  If this weren&#x27;t the case, I have no doubt we&#x27;d see far more women in fields that require a high degree of risk, creativity, and collaboration.     \\n</td>\n",

These books are simply index books. They go over the land mark concepts in mathematics along with the key theorems and how they evolved in the historical context. You will be surpriced at how obvious things took years for people to learn and will come to appreciate the value of mathematical knowledge. The algorithm will be like this: You want to know about some field of mathematics. Say Differential geometry. You can consult the sections on both these books. Will take you about 3 full days. And then go ahead and read the list of suggested books. This is the real gold mine of both these books., they suggest the best books for all of the sub-fields of math.  Besides they really list the key theorems in a few pages with proof sketches and this is like a map for you. You can follow the map to exactly where you want. This sort of idea, you will get only after studying that field for say a year. And these books just give it to you right away.

              "            <td>Another hypothesis as to why companies do better with founders:A company&#x27;s culture is set by its founder(s).  As long as a founder is in charge, the CEO is working with the corporate culture.  When an outside manager is brought in, he usually ends up working against corporate culture.In every company I&#x27;ve worked in, the culture was essentially a reflection of the founder&#x27;s personality.  If there are multiple founders, it reflects a weird amalgam of all the ones that are involved in the daily business.  If an early employee tends to run things in the early days, the culture reflects them as much as the founders.  Think Intel and Andy Grove, or 3M and William McKnight.Companies tend to inherit both the best qualities and worst faults of their founders.  However, their position in the marketplace usually reflects the best qualities.  After all, nobody buys from a company for what it sucks at.An outsider brings his own strengths and weaknesses to the company, but it&#x27;s very unlikely that his strengths will line up with the culture and market that the company already has.  Think John Sculley and Apple - great executive for cola, not so great for computers.  The founder, instead, may have tons of liabilities, but at least he won&#x27;t be fighting the corporate culture he himself has created.There&#x27;s some evidence to back this up, for instance:1.) It echoes the findings in Good to Great: the turnaround process involves applying the \\&quot;hedgehog principle\\&quot; of asking yourself what the company is really passionate about, then getting the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus, and only then changing strategy.  The hedgehog principle is essentially a question about culture: where does the culture of this organization fit into the overall economy.  Then getting the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus consists of strengthening the positive aspects of the company culture and weakening the negative ones.2.) In cases where an outside turnaround CEO has successfully turned around a company, they usually spend a significant amount of time acclimatizing themselves to the existing culture, and only start changing things after they already \\&quot;fit in\\&quot;.  Think Lou Gerstner and IBM.  Even then, they often make decisions that mortgage the long-term health of the company by destroying the previous cultural VALUES (986, 198, .  Gerstner eliminated IBM&#x27;s status as an R&amp;#38;D powerhouse, for example, while James McNerney nearly destroyed 3M&#x27;s innovation culture with Six Sigma.3.) Companies that survive the departure of their founders usually do so by institutionalizing their culture as a set of company VALUES (986, 198, , bringing in fresh recruits out of college before they&#x27;ve been able to pick up a different corporate culture, and then promoting from within to put in place management who already understands the existing culture.  Think GE.  </td>\n",

Of course, because no successor has as large a stake in it as the original founder.  Maybe they should do it like a kingship, slightly modified -- where the successor inherits HALF of the founder&#x27;s equity.  You would stand a much better chance of attracting the best people if they were going to get the billions when you stepped down -- subject to vesting and performance.  Why would the top people want to join an existing company when the big equity has already been taken out of it?So, when you retire you vest half of the Founder&#x27;s stock, if you&#x27;ve been there \\&quot;long enough\\&quot;.  Take a company from $10B market cap to $20B and you&#x27;ve doubled the Founder&#x27;s share, so you get an amount equal to what the whole thing was when you started, and leave an equal amount to lure the next CEO.It&#x27;s late so I may well be missing obvious flaws in the scheme, but some kind of equity retention strategy seems to be needed to promote long-term vitality because the current m.o. is the original founders and investors bleed it all out.\\n</td>\n",

              "            <td>After the introduction of the topic of acquisition from the buyer to the seller, the first major milestone in an acquisition deal is usually a terms sheet.  The terms sheet would be essentially a non-binding high-level agreement to the basic terms of the deal.  Price is just one of many terms.  It is clearly one of the important ones, but there are other sometimes equally important terms in a given deal, such as associated non-compete and consulting contracts.  Also, \\&quot;price\\&quot; is a nebulous term and is usually not just one isolated number.  For instance, there can be earn-outs, hold-backs, escrowed amounts, consulting fees, etc., and all of these can be tied to indemnities, conditions, etc.  And the structure of the deal, e.g. stock vs asset, impacts the net take home to the shareholders, which is what most people are ultimately interested in.Both parties agree on the terms sheet through negotiation.  That sounds obvious, but the point is there is not one set process.  There are many strategies to negotiation and some make more sense than others in the context of a particular deal.  It is not uncommon for parties to walk away and come back to the table at this stage, and in fact, at all stages.  The \\&quot;price\\&quot; could easily move up or down significantly depending on a number of factors.  It really comes down to what the seller is willing to sell for and what the buyer is willing to buy for.  If there is an overlap, there could be a deal.  If not, then no deal.  The rest is jockeying for the overlap.  Walking away until you get x is one tactic to get to the top of the overlap from your perspective.Finally, investment bankers and their equivalents in these situations are not necessary, but they can get you a higher price.  Their basic usefulness is connecting you to potential buyers, i.e. through their roladex.  You, alone, may not know or have access to these potential buyers.  By engaging multiple buyers you can get an auction scenario, which is often ideal because usually buyers willing to pay more for something if they are taking it away from someone else in addition to getting it for themselves.  However, certain tactics can turn off and ultimately dislodge particular buyers from the process, which could be net negative for the shareholders depending on which buyer(s) walked away.  Also, brokers usually take a significant % fee, and if they do not get an auction going, this could just be wasted money.\\n</td>\n",

As the band Genesis has proven, you simply cannot replace Phil Collins with Ray Wilson and expect to have a mega-band again.  Ray&#x27;s music with the band is nice, but the style definitely was markedly different from what most people think of as \\&quot;Genesis.\\&quot;  The same thing happened earlier in the band&#x27;s history too, when Peter Gabriel left and Phil Collins replaced him as the front-man.  Everything changed: the song writing, the style of play, everything.  It took half a decade for people to get used to it.Writing software is kind of the same way.  Just look at the impossible made possible by demo coders on old-school 8-bit computers.  These programs would never have been successfully coded in a commercial organization.  But, -bands- of coders wrote them successfully.  They promoted their software as bands, included self-written music, artwork, etc.It would be interesting to see how a band-style organization would apply towards more practical software products.  Software so produced would come in boxes with the band&#x27;s logo, but more importantly, a _list of credits_, anecdotes about the software&#x27;s creation, etc.  That is, to make the delivery of the software more _human_.Back in the day, when credits on software were more commonplace, it was possible to judge the quality of a product (to some extent) based on who was involved with it.  Some people became reknowned coders, reknowned technical writers, etc.  I think it gave two incentives: first, your name is going on the box of that package -- this gave prestige in the community post-sale; second, it allowed the customers to predict the overall feel of the software prior to actually purchasing it, based on their experiences with software written by the same or similar authors.Literature is another example.  People flock to this blog because of the name, Paul Graham, just as much as they do for the information contained therein.  People buy books from famous authors because the authors are well known to produce good work.  People often subscribe to magazines only to read one or two columns by well-known authors.  So, in a very real sense, tacking your name on something is a seal of authenticity and a seal of quality all rolled into one.  And, people like that.I know I do.\\n</td>\n",

It&#x27;s happened to me a bunch of times: \\&quot;OK, where was I?... the grommit plugs into the foobar, and the whatzit sends a message to the widget... wait a minute, no it doesn&#x27;t, it sends to the frobnosticator first!  WHY on earth was I thinking that for all that time before the break??\\&quot;Sometimes it&#x27;s as simple as the famous case of getting somebody else to look at your code and immediately point out what&#x27;s wrong that two hours of staring at the screen couldn&#x27;t accomplish.Other times it&#x27;s a lot more subtle, high-level and abstract.  Since, in those cases, it&#x27;s often difficult to discuss the problem with somebody else, you don&#x27;t get a) the outside feedback to speed things along and b) the humiliation factor that makes you remember how the insight came about. ;)  So the meta-revelation of how you came to that revelation might be lacking, and it&#x27;s attributed to the subconscious instead.</td>\n",

If the answer is \\&quot;no\\&quot;, then forget it... don&#x27;t learn how to program. Instead, find a programmer who likes your ideas and is willing to implement them for you, as an equal partner. This may be tough to find, but that&#x27;s what you have to do. Ideas have tons of value. In my opinion, ideas are insanely important. The best-engineered, slickest, cutting-edge application isn&#x27;t going to make a flipping cent unless the user-facing features add value. And these features can be formed from ideas that ANYONE has - not just programmers. Don&#x27;t think that you have to be a programmer to have great ideas; that&#x27;s utter bullshit. That being said, I think you do need to know your way around technology, because as a lot of people say you need to know the options; what is feasible, what is not feasible; what powers and raw functionalities you have at your disposal. Read Wikipedia articles about things like AJAX, server-side computing, search algorithms, social computing, etc. Watch Google Tech Talks about whatever sounds cool to you. Try to figure out what the current state of technology is - in terms of functionality and capabilities - across the CS\\/software board. You don&#x27;t need to be a programmer to do this. But don&#x27;t struggle through concepts that you find boring; read about stuff that seems cool and interesting. The bottom line is, do what you love, period. Yeah it&#x27;s cliche. But if you take up an activity because you care about the end result, and not about the journey, you&#x27;re going to end up frustrated and will probably just give up. Whatever you&#x27;re passionate about, do just that, and find someone else who&#x27;s passionate about the rest to work with you.But you should give programming an honest shot anyway, to find out if you like it.

For IBM.- YC encourages people (not just kids) to build things.  For the people building them.- EB teams must have \\&quot;business\\&quot; and \\&quot;technical\\&quot; people, selected by a random manager at IBM.- YC teams are self-selected, and are judged by what they produce, not what label they use to describe their abilities.- EB teams build something that may, or may not, ever see the light of day in the market.- YC teams build something that, if they work hard, can hit the market whenever they&#x27;re ready.  No manager ever has to sign off on the project.In short, EB is a corporate internship and YC is an opportunity to build something great (you don&#x27;t need YC to build something great, but for many folks it can help).  Corporate internships are fine, and I&#x27;m sure everyone has a great time and IBM gets its pick of some great talent discovered through the process, but it is just a corporate inernship.  It is distinctly not a radical new process to encourage spinning up new businesses.I&#x27;m not disparaging IBM here.  This sounds like a great idea for them.

That&#x27;s always a mistake. Yet another we&#x27;ve all made. Just like a car, relationships never die without plenty of warning.

The classical approach is that you have a melody in your head and work backwards from there. The other approach is to improvise - more like jazz, where the musicians are playing off each other and the audience.In code, the classical approach is akin to the waterfall method. Design it all up front. Build it with statically linked tools. Hire programmers like an orchestra, based on their ability to follow the score. The iterative approach is more like jazz. Write a little bit. Bounce it off other people. Write a little more. A conversation. Duck typed scripting languages are great for that.And then there&#x27;s interaction design.

Are you talking about sound production, performing, composing?The main difference with composing is that you are usually writing a program for a real person to perform, not for a computer to execute.   This means that writing music is less exacting, but can also be more subtle.  The other big difference is that you aren&#x27;t usually writing music to solve an external problem.  With music, you have to invent the problems you want to solve.  You might say \\&quot;I want to hold an F# in the alto line for 4 measures, while moving all the other voices in a chord progression that adheres to the following restrictions...\\&quot;  You just make up the conditions on your own.  Software, in contrast, almost always solves a concrete, defineable problem (even if you don&#x27;t know what that problem will be when you start coding).With performing, the biggest difference is that it&#x27;s real-time action and communication.  You have to train physically in order to be good, and learning bad habits is disastrous.  Code-reading and being good at using an editor are more analogous to music performance than software development in general.  With writing code, it can be a good thing to write 1,000 lines of crap, if you learn enough not to make those mistakes again.

This seems a somewhat weak ending given the rest of the article, however reasonable this conclusion may be.  Furthermore, to quote myself:\\n\\&quot;...one of my favorite anecdotes from Blink is the tale of the identical ice cream: the same ice cream was wrapped in two different packages, one plain, the other fancy, and taken around to the public for taste tests. People actually reported that the ice cream in the &#x27;fancier&#x27; package _tasted_ better. What&#x27;s great about this story is that it&#x27;s an excellent way to explain to someone the value of beauty to usability. Given two functionally identical products, users will believe that one is _easier to use_ simply by virtue of it being aesthetically pleasing. I once saw a presentation at a UPA (Usability Professionals Assoc) Conference where a study showed just that - a product with identical information architecture was run through two usability tests: one where the product had a rudimentary look and feel, and one where the look and feel had been touched up by a graphic designer. User data showed that people felt the prettier version was easier for them to use, even though it took them the same time to complete tasks in both versions. Now, as an interaction designer myself, I would hope this argument is never used to dismiss the importance of interaction design and information architecture. We can&#x27;t use aesthetics to &#x27;put lipstick on the pig,&#x27; as one of my coworkers is fond of saying. But if you&#x27;ve taken the time to make a really usable product which meets a user need, imagine how much people will love it if you ALSO make it beautiful. That, for me, is the definition of a \\&quot;delightful experience.\\&quot; \\&quot; (http:\\/\\/news.ycombinator.com\\/item?id=38839)</td>\n",

Then I took a long holiday from startup stuff while I was in college, though I did have primary implementation responsibility for a non-profit.

Yes, there is a correlation between higher education and higher salaries -- no, this does not imply causation!There are many confounding factors:  People who are more intelligent, have parent(s) who pursued higher education, have parents with higher income, or are white are both more likely to receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree AND on average earn more than other people with the same amount of education.  (In the past, being male was a predictor for both higher education and higher earnings, but this is not a significant factor for people born after 1980.)In addition, the statistic ignores the fact that pursuing higher education shortens one&#x27;s career -- people who spend 4-5 years in college on average work for 2-3 years less than those who started their careers immediately after high school.  As a result, comparing \\&quot;40-year careers\\&quot; is bogus -- the only reasonable comparison is between the total careers of individuals, including the time when one person is at college while the other is working.Finally, even if the statistic were computed correctly and reflected causation, it would be misleading: Different careers are not influenced equally by education.  Generally speaking, people don&#x27;t finish their education before they start thinking about what career the will pursue; someone who was planning on becoming a plumber isn&#x27;t likely to suddenly decide that he wants to become a brain surgeon just because he finds that he has a bachelor&#x27;s degree.Decide what you want to do (either as a single career, or more likely thinking of a number of careers which seem interesting), and look at what qualifications are needed for those.

What I think is great about YC&#x27;s structure is that it gives startups feedback and deadlines, and I agree that just getting those is enough to keep startups going.  Someone should start a startup that just calls people once a week and talks with them about what they got done!  It would work even better if the caller was of higher status, but it would work well enough with friends.But seriously, for startups this would work great.  Get together with a group and make a weekly appointment for each person to call another each week and chat about what they&#x27;re doing, preferably with a little demo.

They believed that it was right to put Squash courts and Polo fields in far flung countries.  They believed that Britishness was the most natural state of man.  The French, Russians and eventually the Germans felt the same way about themselves, only more so and less sucessfully.  These empires were Goliaths and their people were proud of them.  The US was the first major colony to successfully break free from the Brits.  The most formidable military force ever deployed sailed into the East River and bore down on a bunch of un-uniformed barefoot rabble representing our (at that time) pathetic revolution.  Yet somehow we won.  That picture was chopped up and burned into the DNA of every American.  We re-live it when Bruce Willis crawls through air-ducts and elevator shafts to outwit German terrorists.  And again when he leads his band of blue collar drillers to blow up a merciless asteriod.  And his goals are simple too.  Bruce just wants to get home in time for dinner whereas James Bond is \\&quot;keeping the British end up.\\&quot;  Americans are wary of higher causes which makes them distrust things bigger than themselves.It&#x27;s everywhere in this country, Big is bad and small is good.  We hate Wallmart, Microsoft, Nike and Exxon.  Nevermind that Target, Adobe, Reebok and Shell are doing the exact same thing as their bigger counterparts.  They&#x27;re not big so we can&#x27;t hate them.  The only thing that will \\&quot;kill\\&quot; Google (IBM \\/ MS style) will be bigness.  We will turn against them once they become Goliath.  Our people (formerly your people) banded together way back then and forged our ideals in violent reaction against bigness.  And so it&#x27;s been ever since.  We were the 12th biggest army just before WWII and few thought we would outlast the Soviets.  But once the Soviet Empire fell we became Goliath and we have hated ourselves ever since.  The Brits and Russians in their prime would have no problem with Iraq.  The Russians would roll in and kill everyone and the Brits would pit the Sunnis against the Shias and colonize what&#x27;s left.  We have gone in half cocked and we don&#x27;t truely believe that it&#x27;s our place to tell other people how to live.  It is cruely ironic that we may have to sail back across the pond and ask our British cousins how we can best play the part of Goliath.  This is all a long way of saying that revering startups is just natural to us.  It&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve always done and for better or worse, it&#x27;s all we know.  I&#x27;m actually not sure why they were ever called startups.  Upstarts is way more fitting...</td>\n",

You see that variation even within the US. Stanford students are more entrepreneurial than Yale students, but not because of some difference in their characters; the Yale students just have fewer examples.I admit there seem to be different attitudes toward ambition in Europe and the US. In the US it&#x27;s ok to be overtly ambitious, and in most of Europe it&#x27;s not. But this can&#x27;t be an intrinsically European quality; previous generations of Europeans were as ambitious as Americans. What happened? My hypothesis is that ambition was discredited by the terrible things ambitious people did in the first half of the twentieth century. Now swagger is out. (Even now the image of a very ambitious German presses a button or two, doesn&#x27;t it?)It would be surprising if European attitudes weren&#x27;t affected by the disasters of the twentieth century. It takes a while to be optimistic after events like that. But ambition is human nature. Gradually it will re-emerge.\\&quot;</td>\n",

I could be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think this is the case for Europe or countries like Japan; it&#x27;s much harder to try something entrepreneurial more than once if you failed the 1st time...Case in point, I think it took Sam Walton over ten tries before he got it right with Walmart.

This has driven the US to become a destination for many of the world&#x27;s immigrants, leaving their own countries less populated with potential risk takers. The notion of a free market is what distinguished the US from its European counterparts at its inception and has since demonstrated the ability to learn and grow. The benefit of the US at that time was a clean slate economy without all of the potential &#x27;baggage&#x27; that the European countries possessed in the monarchical systems. What&#x27;s more, for the most part it didn&#x27;t matter where you came from or who your family was in the US. All that mattered was market potential.Though European countries have moved their economies in much the same direction they still have to contend with the history of their governments.

New ideas take time to be successfully introduced on an indigenous level if they are to become part of the cultural paradigm and identified history. </td>\n",

Conversion to using SQLAlchemy was supposed to address the gaps, but the branch for the upgrade seems pretty dead...

And if the person is tall, and their kids are tall, $500 a year is likely not enough to cover the extra costs of food.  If there should be a change, it should be that the government should pass a law that tall people should be paid at least $5,000 a year more, to cover bigger, non-entry level, non-Toyota or Honda sedans and SUV&#x27;s, worse gas mileage, greater car expenses, and the price of size XL-Tall and 2XL-Tall clothing from specialty stores since regular stores don&#x27;t carry tall sizes.Why don&#x27;t articles write about that?  Everybody wants to point out that tall people earn $500 a year more, on average, but not the fact that shorter people come out on top.  That extra $1 a day does not cover the extra food for one person, let alone a family, nor does it cover the greater car, specialty clothing, gas, car repair, car insurance, and other expenses whatsoever for even one tall person, nor their family.A tall person may also use shampoo and soap much faster, and need to use more water in the shower.If anything, the status quo encourages more short people to reproduce.And, if taller people actually are \\&quot;smarter\\&quot; or more productive (for whatever reason, be it confidence or something else) then they&#x27;re _really_ getting the short end of the stick by having to survive with $4,500 less yearly taxable income.(I like to think from both sides of the issue, and I haven&#x27;t seen that side addressed any time the issue has been brought up.)</td>\n",

              "            <td>MoinMoin is extensible and modular system. You can replace almost any part of the system by installing a plugin. It is the best system for a typical wiki hosted on your server, if you like to extend and customize the system, and you happen to like Python.A wiki page can use any markup supported by the system parsers. MoinMoin comes with its own markup, rst, plain text and docbook parsers. Parsers for other markups created by the community are in http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/ParserMarket. You add your own parser that know how to parse the text and how to drive the formatter, which create the html. Parsers are also used for syntax highlighting. Moin comes with cplusplus, CSV, irc, java, pascal and python. Formatter can create any output you like - the default create html, and the system provides other formatters for xml, docbook and plain text. You can add your own formatter if needed. Any page can be formatted in any exiting format, for example http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/?action=format&amp;#38;mimetype=t....To create custom applications, you usually add both action and macro plugins. Macro is a plugin that execute when a page is rendered and return output. Action is a plugin that handle request to urls like \\/wiki\\/pagename?action=foo. Most of MoinMoin UI is implemented in terms of actions and marcos, so for example, if you want to have a different RecentChanges - you can simply install a modified RecentChanges macro in your wiki. You can find lot of actions and macros in http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/ActionMarket and http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/MacroMarket.Formatted pages are compiled to Python bytecode, and literally executed when a page is visited. Static macros run when a page is compiled, and their output is compiled into the page. Dynamic macro are executed during page runtime, and are used to provide user, time or namespace dependent data.MoinMoin let you have acl for entire wiki, evaluated before and after page acl. You can have a default acl applied to pages without acl, or page specific acl. See http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/HelpOnAccessControlLists. For greater control, you can use your own security policy object, implementing any security scheme you like. See http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/SecurityPolicy.MoinMoin UI can be changed by a theme plugin. A theme is responsible for creating the stuff before an after a page or action content. You can provide multiple themes for single wiki, or your own customized theme. MoinMoin uses plain Python as \\&quot;template\\&quot; language - you can easily change the behavior by overriding few methods. See http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/HelpOnThemes. There are many themes created by the community in http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/ThemeMarket.MoinMoin support Wiki-RPC 1 and 2 http:\\/\\/www.jspwiki.org\\/Wiki.jsp?page=WikiRPCInterface2. You can also add xmlrpc plugin to extend the system as you like.MoinMoin can be deployed on any platform, either using plain CGI (slow), standalone or twisted Python server (e.g. behind Apache), or using  FastCGI (recommended) or mod_python (more tricky).There is a GUI editor - modified FCKEditor, which may be easier for common users, but it has issues.Search is very powerful, supporting Google style modifiers, booleans and regular expressions. However, search become slow on big wikis. For typical wiki it is just fine. For bigger wikis it is painfully slow. See http:\\/\\/moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de\\/HelpOnSearching. There is an experimental index search engine using Lupy. The next version will have a better search using http:\\/\\/www.xapian.org\\/.MoinMoin has great Unicode support - anything can be unicode: page content, page names, group names, user names and even passwords. User names can also contain spaces, so users can register with their real name.MoinMoin has the best Right to Left support. You can define a language and direction for whole wiki, single page, sections within a page, or words within a paragraph. Other systems either does not support this, or have partial support using raw html.\\n</td>\n",

(There are extensions for controlling access, but it&#x27;s added security and they have to patch holes where you can see data that should be protected.)I like the simplicity and DB-free nature of DokuWiki. Because wiki pages are simple text files, you can easily add wiki pages through some scripts and backup\\/syncing is as easy as it gets.  The plugin architecture is good. Uploads go a namespaced upload area, so it&#x27;s easy to embed and share uploaded files between wiki pages.MoinMoin is an OK wiki with the advantage that it&#x27;s python.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to create wiki farms with MoinMoin, and you can add \\&quot;macros\\&quot; so pushing a button will get you a wiki page from different templates.  Sections in a wiki page (delimited by headers) aren&#x27;t independently editable, unlike the two PHP wikis above. User uploads are through page-specific attachments, unlike the more global space for file uploads in DokuWiki. You can have an ACL per page, but I like the Authorization system in DokuWiki better because it allows ACLs for entire namespaces.All of the above are easily skinned. For example, in DokuWiki, we can change from my lab website skin (http:\\/\\/taylorlab.stanford.edu) to the default skin (http:\\/\\/wiki.splitbrain.org\\/wiki:dokuwiki) using a drop-down menu.</td>\n",

Here&#x27;s a quote from a pro-blocking blog post that nickb linked to in another comment:\\&quot;Frankly, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, if a webmaster runs a site that&#x27;s popular enough that the costs become at all significant, the onus is on him (or her) to find ways to cash in on that popularity to keep the site going. The visitors have no duty at all, and they certainly aren&#x27;t obliged to go out of their way to make money for somebody else.\\&quot;My response is that they did come up with a way to monetize their content (ads), but you don&#x27;t like it. Too bad. Don&#x27;t go to the site if you don&#x27;t like the way they&#x27;ve chosen to make money. This goes along the same lines that if music is too expensive, or has DRM, that you therefore get to download it for free via filesharing, bittorrent, etc.... You don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re only ethical option is to not buy the content. That&#x27;s the only ethical way you send a message (in this trivial context, obviously if were talking about human rights, etc..., the ethics of protest methodologies become more complicated). If I think something in a brick and mortar store is too expensive, would anyone think it was ok for me to just steal it? I don&#x27;t think so. A lot of the complaints about bad advertising practices, obtrusive adds, DRM, overpriced content are in fact valid complaints.

Isn&#x27;t the job of an advertiser to produce content that entices somebody to buy something? If the ad doesn&#x27;t do that, if it actually repels the person from looking at it, then that&#x27;s a crappy ad.

I help (for free) Atlanta-based hacker teams think through the \\&quot;legal issues\\&quot; involved in starting a business, but I&#x27;m not really a lawyer any more. It&#x27;s not that complicated:(1) IMHO you should think first about the founder equity vesting issues. On the one hand, it wouldn&#x27;t be fair for a co-founder to bail out after 2 months and keep all of her equity. On the other hand, it wouldn&#x27;t be fair if her co-founders kicked her out after 2 months for no reason and left her with almost no equity. So there&#x27;s a balance that needs to be reached, and the discussion can be emotional. With the lawyer&#x27;s help, the team can strike their desired balance in an agreement that governs equity vesting, such as a restricted stock agreement. I can send you a sample agreement to illuminate the trade-offs. waytking AT gmail DOT com.(2a) If all founders can&#x27;t agree on the founder equity vesting balance, you do not have a startup team. Form another one. (2b) If all founders agree on founder equity vesting balance, your lawyer can easily form your Delaware C-corp for a few hundred bucks. If you want ultimate flexibility, he can form a Delaware LLC and create your LLC operating agreement for around a thousand bucks. But a C-corp should be fine. Pay in cash - don&#x27;t pay in equity. In any city with a decent-sized tech community there will be lawyers willing to do the above for just a few hundred dollars, in the hope that you&#x27;ll be successful and get big and give them significant legal work later on. You may need to dig to find such lawyers in your city, but they are there. You will also be tempted to engage lawyers who promise to introduce you to VCs, angels, etc. IMHO this is not that valuable. If you are smart and resourceful, you will find the angels and VCs. If you are building stuff people want, the angels and VCs will invest in you, especially if you make them think you don&#x27;t need their stinkin&#x27; money.</td>\n",

Static typing and lack of first-class functions or easy data types make Java programs verbose and annoying to change.  The JVM, on the other hand, is fast, portable, well-specified, and there are a ton of libraries that run on it.To have the best of both worlds, you can use the JVM to run a more dynamic language (not Java)!  There are many projects to bring different languages to the JVM, but my favorite is Rhino, which compiles JavaScript to bytecodes.

I still decided against Java because I feel that meta programming could be that great enabler of the next productivity revolution. A revolution that smarter people than me have experienced ages ago. Having explored Java to some extremes, I know that many of the complexities of something like J2EE are down to the lack of powerful language internal meta programming facilities.Why not JRuby? Because right now JRuby is even slower than C based Ruby and Ruby 2 will have a virtual machine too, which  doesn&#x27;t have to concern itself with anything other than serving Ruby. Yes, Java has a lot of libraries. But how many of those am I really using in my startup? Quite a few, and it does take me some time to figure out good alternatives for Ruby. But at the end of the day the library issue doesn&#x27;t make a big difference in my case.The only thing that really concerns me about the popular dynamic languages is raw speed for algorithmic stuff. Yes I do need that for what I&#x27;m doing.

We had to do three applicants every ten minutes, which works out to just over three minutes per app. In that amount of time you can quickly scan over the grades and SATs, and maybe read the first paragraph of each essay if you&#x27;re lucky. The other thing I learned is that the real admissions officers got statistics updates twice a day for the average GPA and SAT score, and also the projected US News rank. This means that whether or not your grades and SATs were good enough depended largely on whether your app was read before or after lunch, because what it took to get into the college completely changed every time they were handed the new report.For low income minority students there was an option to set the app aside for a second reading in order to learn more about the student&#x27;s situation and if there were an ameliorating factors, but for the rest of the students the admissions officers were expected to make a decision on the first pass after the three minutes. Athletes also largely got pre-approved by the academic department they were applying for, so they pretty much knew whether they&#x27;d be accepted before they ever applied. The flip side is that they only got an edge in admissions if they applied early decision, because if they were going to bring down the average GPA then they had to bring up the average matriculation in order to not affect the overall US News rank.I think it&#x27;s one of those things like eVoting. That is, people with no CS experience think eVoting is totally secure whereas CS experts know it isn&#x27;t. Similarly, I highly suspect that anyone who thinks getting admitted to an Ivy shows a certain baseline level of respectability has never worked in admissions. I&#x27;d guarantee it.As for the importance of college GPA, if you want to see something funny then apply for a wall street job. If they ask you what your GPA was in college, ask them how GPA correlates with alpha. :-)The craziest thing was that Google did a massive HR survey and determined that there was basically zero correlation between college GPA and value created for the company. Because of this they decided that they would give jobs to five or six people with sub 3.0 GPAs each year. Well if there is little or no correlation, why should it matter what GPA is at all? I suspect the psychology behind the Google hiring process has a lot in common with the psychology of female circumcision. That is, it was done to me so it must be a good thing. And if it&#x27;s a good thing, then by definition it must be good to do unto others.edit: fixed a few grammatical errors</td>\n",

              "            <td>I was amazed initially (though that quickly faded) how few truly \\&quot;smart\\&quot; undergraduates there were at MIT in the 9 years I hung around there.  I put smart in quotes because I really don&#x27;t like that word, but I don&#x27;t have a great substitute either.  Obviously they were smart enough to get in.  But most were significantly lacking in at least one necessary area to be labeled \\&quot;smart\\&quot; IMO (often several), including intuitiveness, creativity, being a self-starter, analytical thinking, breadth and depth of knowledge, intellectual curiosity, etc.Putting exact numbers on it is difficult due to the self-segregation at MIT and subjectivity obviously at play.  However, I would say perhaps 30% fall into the seriously lacking category, another 30% in a substantially lacking category and another 25% in a good but not great category (perhaps lacking only one major thing).  That leaves only 15% or so of people I came across I would say were \\&quot;smart\\&quot; in the sense described above.  When you move to people with the essential qualities necessary to work successfully at a really early stage startup, I would say it drops to 7% or so.   I&#x27;m not saying found one, just work at one as one of the first employees.  When you move to people with all the founding qualities, the % probably drops to 1-2%.  I know this first hand after trying to start companies with people in the \\&quot;smart\\&quot; category.The above has really hit home other times as well.   Here are two more occasions.  First, when graduating, 62 people in my class out of about 1,080 (~6%) were inducted into Phi Beta Kappa.  I was shocked at a) how many of these people were my friends at MIT; b) how many of these people I had come across (given that I didn&#x27;t meet all 1,080; and c) that this list included pretty much all of the people I had previously labeled \\&quot;smart\\&quot; myself in my class that I had come across.  Second, my wife taught statistics at MIT for several years.  One time a kid came up to her complaining about an exam grade and told her it was not possible to have gotten an A on this exam.  He said all his friends studied real hard and yet they all ended up with Cs and Ds.  To which she replied, actually roughly 30% of the class got As.  The point is, they were completely self-segregated by \\&quot;smartness\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t even really know it.All that being said, an MIT degree really does go a long way in terms of impressing the average person\\/company.  I have done independent consulting and applied for jobs where they basically stopped researching me when they saw MIT.  That is the rule, not the exception.  And that was in Boston.  Now that I live in PA, it seems even more shocking to people to come across someone from MIT.  Given the above, and in agreement with PG, this behavior is unwarranted.  I of course am thankful, but it also annoys me that so many people are free-riding on the name.</td>\n",

There are two arguments happening here. The first is that entrepreneurship and business success are not so well correlated with where you go to undergrad. The second is that where you go to college doesn&#x27;t make much of a difference in life in general. I won&#x27;t really quarrel with the first, since it&#x27;s been demonstrated pretty often, and YC&#x27;s results support it as well. The second, on the other hand...The main problem with trying to assert that college doesn&#x27;t make a difference in life is that there&#x27;s really no easy measurement you can do over \\&quot;net change\\&quot; in life. That&#x27;s due both to the long span of time a life consumes as well as the complex and\\/or fuzzy cause-effect relationships that are at play throughout. At best, I think, you would need to argue over objective differences that have some immediate effect, and then hope that those actually do make a difference. As an example, here are some of the things that I think made Paul Graham successful that are pretty strongly related to his going to graduate school at Harvard: - he met RTM and Trevor there- he got to spend his time in Boston, where he&#x27;s acknowledged startups can thrive- being able to drop the H-bomb almost certainly helped give credibility to his company- he learned Lisp (not really the most popular language at the time, except at certain places)Would Viaweb have happened had he gone elsewhere, or skipped grad school altogether? Well, maybe. But I doubt it. Harvard&#x27;s name is what convened the talent (peers, advisors, mentors, investors) that shaped much of that company, and it&#x27;s there that Harvard&#x27;s value lies.

So if you just want to start a web startup and get rich, fine, but if you want to go to grad school after you get rich, not so fine. 2) I&#x27;ve taken classes at CMU, Berkeley, and Stanford, and while the differences didn&#x27;t particularly correlate with the rankings (since the relative rankings of those three places in CS get permuted regularly anyway), there were serious differences in attitude and rigor. CMU and Berkeley were both very rigorous; the difference was that CMU was rigorous in a somewhat more pointless, soul-sucking manner, on average, and didn&#x27;t explain things as well. Stanford was somewhat less rigorous, which I imagine was because of the Ivy-league difficult-to-get-in but easy-to-pass phenomenon. This seems to correlate somewhat with the number of undergrads at each place involved in research; at both CMU and Berkeley, I know many undergrads involved in research, while the one professor I talk to at Stanford hungrily scrounges for the rare undergrad who&#x27;s good at research. So there are differences in curriculum and selection, I think; they&#x27;re just not particularly amazing predictors of success. They certainly should influence the decision of which colleges to apply to, though. </td>\n",

In the first months or year or whatever it takes, you don&#x27;t have enough to pay for the problem to go away, but you can&#x27;t ignore payroll, insurance, income taxes, franchise taxes for the corporation, basic bookkeeping and accounting.I&#x27;m not even sure what kind of person to hire for some of these tasks.  Obviously an accountant is expensive overkill for payroll and bookkeeping, and the accountants I have known outsource it.  Administaff doesn&#x27;t seem to like very small companies (or at least they charge as though they don&#x27;t like them).  The online services I&#x27;ve used for payroll have ended up with me doing most of the hard work by hand (they&#x27;re glorified calculators with all the percentages already punched in, but they don&#x27;t handle actually paying people or getting the taxes paid).And, of course, no one should ever be without health insurance for any period of time.  It&#x27;s just too much risk.  But I haven&#x27;t found health insurance to be the hardest part to deal with: just call up Unicare.  They provide individuals with reasonable health care plans for reasonable price.  I pay $84\\/month for a crappy plan (but I&#x27;m in good health, with no bad or dangerous habits, so I just want to know that if I go to the hospital it won&#x27;t bankrupt me).Also, as for aston&#x27;s point, you might be surprised.  Group health insurance is much more expensive than individual plans for young healthy people (most of what YC funds).  I looked into it and group insurance for me would cost about $280\\/month, vs. the $84 I&#x27;m paying now.  The insurance a company buys for you has to deal with pre-existing conditions, dependents, all ages, etc. and generally doesn&#x27;t even discriminate based on smoker\\/non-smoker status.  Of course, the group rates I was looking at were for a 2-10 person company, while YC would be covering 50 or so people, so the rates might be considerably lower at that scale.Anyway, it&#x27;s not a bad idea for YC to do something about all of these stupid but necessary aspects of business.  The days I&#x27;m doing bookkeeping or payroll or taxes are days that are really painful...I can&#x27;t think of anything in my day to day life that I hate more.  I&#x27;m now in a position to pay someone for them to go away, but I&#x27;d have to find that someone or someones...But that&#x27;s just me complaining.  ;-)</td>\n",

In terms of information content, the PG links are going to be low because almost everyone here would have read the article regardless.Seriously, is the 100 karma points gained through linking to a pg essay worth as much as the 100 earned through 10 informative (in the classic suprising sense) links?  We seem to be converging to this eigenvector [a(1) a(2) ...a(n)] where a(1) == pg_essay_link, a(2)== mattmaroon_essay_link...etc.The reason I believe pg converted this forum to hacker news is that the learning machine was stuck on the search surface in a local minimum and he wanted it to &#x27;learn&#x27; new things.  We can&#x27;t learn more if we reward behaviour that is not truly informative.

This is where I think a simple messaging system for the site would be useful, especially given the networking incentives of beginning startup entrepreneurs..I think there may also be a general reluctance to post things which are challenging or negative for fear of either being downvoted like crazy, or looking bad in the eyes of YC if you have plans to apply. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as calling it sucking up, but it could refrain some people from saying whats really on their mind.The rate of submissions seems to be increasing too, which can make sifting through the new postings more difficult. It also dilutes commenting I&#x27;ve noticed. This could be why major posts like a new PG essay seem to gravitate more discussion. I would personally be game for the idea of limiting the number of new submissions a user can post over a given time. Maybe scale this value based on karma. This would at least make people think more carefully about what they are about to post. I understand this starts to limit the \\&quot;anyone can post\\&quot; nature of the site, but it could reap an overall benefit for all users by reducing information overload and concentrating discussion on fewer, good submissions.But you bring up a good point..

You&#x27;ll either get mired in what I call \\&quot;Fancy C++ Voodoo Magic\\&quot; by over designing your code and doing weird template meta-programming without any real goal or just use the wrong idioms, or forget about some random subtleties.- Sometimes you really do need to write systems software. In these instances, I&#x27;m still going to use C++. I won&#x27;t claim that C++ is a great language, but at the end of the day, the  benefits provided by C++ make it worth it. It would just be more footwork in C. Classes, RAII, STL, templates, type-safety are all worth it. But this is because I have already made all the mistakes and written lots of bad C++ that I&#x27;m now able to write clean, simple and elegant C++. I&#x27;d advise a newbie programmer against becoming a C++ expert. It&#x27;s not worth the time and effort to learn all the stupid cases and to learn when to use which feature and to what degree to avoid falling into the swamp of C++. It&#x27;s worth knowing C++ well enough that you can hack systems code though. I wouldn&#x27;t say \\&quot;only learn C and not C++ for systems hacking!\\&quot;</td>\n",

I thought &#x27;I wonder what would happen, if there were a language so complicated, so difficult to learn, that nobody would ever be able to swamp the market with programmers? Actually, I got some of the ideas from X10, you know, X windows. That was such a bitch of a graphics system, that it only just ran on those Sun 3\\/60 things. They had all the ingredients for what I wanted. A really ridiculously complex syntax, obscure functions, and pseudo-OO structure. Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows code. Motif is the only way to go if you want to retain your sanity.[NJW Comment: That explains everything. Most of my thesis work was in raw X-windows. :)]Interviewer: You&#x27;re kidding...?Stroustrup: Not a bit of it. In fact, there was another problem. Unix was written in &#x27;C&#x27;, which meant that any &#x27;C&#x27; programmer could very easily become a systems programmer. Remember what a mainframe systems programmer used to earn?Interviewer: You bet I do, that&#x27;s what I used to do.Stroustrup: OK, so this new language had to divorce itself from Unix, by hiding all the system calls that bound the two together so nicely. This would enable guys who only knew about DOS to earn a decent living too.Interviewer: I don&#x27;t believe you said that...source: http:\\/\\/members.safe-t.net\\/jwalker\\/programming\\/interview.html</td>\n",

I guess the most frustrating thing is that _lack_ of regulation is not going to solve anything either.  One thing that lack of regulation on this issue does is make it substantially more difficult for small innovators to reap the benefits of their efficiency.  Those tiny, seemingly insignificant increases in efficiency go practically unnoticed by the large monolithic telecos, but the people who are in the position to innovate further upon those marginal efficiencies (increasing rate of return on efficiency, if that makes sense) cannot do so when the ISPs themselves are taking more than a reasonable share from the people who are doing the innovating (whether the innovators are customers or competitors is important to the ISPs in that I imagine most ISPs would rather have innovative customers than innovative competitors).

Google and Facebook would&#x27;ve gone broke without outside funding of some kind, long before they found a way to generate significant revenue.2) VCs are advisors, and are likely smarter than you about lots of things-- especially how to sell a company.  If you want a lifestyle business (37Signals, for example), then avoid VC.  If you want to sell a company, you&#x27;ll have a better chance (and sell it for more money) with a motivated VC.3) Sales, marketing, and support cost money, for most businesses.  If you&#x27;ve got paying customers, telling them \\&quot;sorry, I&#x27;m at my day job\\&quot; just won&#x27;t play.  For a consumer play, this is less of an issue.4) A lot of ideas (b2b, mostly) just aren&#x27;t simple enough to bootstrap with 3 people and 18 months.  Of course, it&#x27;s easy enough to avoid those business ideas. ;-)5) Businesses are ticking timebombs.  Stretch out your development time and your stretching out the opportunity for disaster.  A team member can lose interest or get a great job, a killer competitor can manifest and snatch up your customers, etc.6) Momentum.  I can say with experience that it&#x27;s REALLY hard to keep momentum going with 3 people working part time (I&#x27;m doing it right now).  When you put a startup on the back burner, it&#x27;s rare that you all get to focus on it at the same time.  When you&#x27;re rarin&#x27; to go, your partner is \\&quot;really slammed this week\\&quot;.7) Necessity drives success.  When your startup is your full-time job and you have an investor looking over your shoulder, your going to work harder and better. If you&#x27;ve got a job, startup failure is more of an option and delays aren&#x27;t very painful.8) Debt or VC can get you to the point where your growth curve starts quicker.  When you are confident about the fact that you&#x27;re on track to build a zillion dollar business, $100k of debt\\/equity financing get get you there a LOT faster.All that being said, I&#x27;ve sold two bootstrapped companies-- it works.I&#x27;d advocate for bootstrapping your way to the point where you know if you&#x27;re on to something.  If you can prove that the market desperately wants what you&#x27;re building, then it USUALLY makes sense to get some cash (via debt or equity)...

This can take many forms, e.g. a PR firm, adwords, traditional advertising, etc.3) If you have a working customer acquisition channel that requires money, and more money will help you grow faster, you might want to do it just to grow faster, outpace competition, etc.</td>\n",

Moreover it accounts for future growth with MySQL Cluster. While MySQL Cluster is not yet mature (though this may change soon), it&#x27;s there, it&#x27;s open, and it&#x27;s why I chose MySQL for my startup, even though I&#x27;m a Postgres veteran. The problem with Postgres (and most databases without clustering) is when you need more resources your only option is to buy a bigger box to replace your current one.

              "            <td>Hello everyone, this is the infamous #2 here. Yes, I am a co-founder of a new Web 2.0 startup and do have the Hacker News RSS feed on my homepage. Airing our dirty laundry in a public forum wasn&#x27;t my decision, but. . .I feel like I have to defend myself a bit about all of the negative comments. We are clearly in the product development stage and I&#x27;m not a developer, so my efforts are focused on enabling #1 to spend 100% of his time on product development. I have 2 years VC experience and 3 years LBO experience (where I am now), so I do all the legal agreements (options, LLC filings, prop rights agreements, Trademark filings, contribution\\/consulting agreements, etc.) and I&#x27;m the one that negotiates and drafts terms for all of our other developers (they tend to come and go due to the lack of cash to pay). I file taxes, pay the bills, and track financials to report to investors on a quarterly basis.  I prepare executive summaries to send to prospective investors and submit to conferences. I am the one that plays \\&quot;bad cop\\&quot; with the developers when things aren&#x27;t going well or they are underferforming so #1 can maintain a good working relationship. I help with design, layout, and other ideas related to the site, mainly with UI, new features, and catching bugs\\/fixes. I interact often with our Alpha users to stay in touch with what they need and what they want. Soon I will start helping with writing tests since I asked #1 what I could do to help more directly with Beta short of learning Ruby. Some of the toughest decisions that we face having so much to do with so few resources to do it with is WHAT to work on, and I try to have open conversations with the team to make sure we&#x27;re prioritizing everything right and agree as a group, because startups tend to start to ramble along unless we discuss what we absolutely need to get out the door every week. So, I wouldn&#x27;t say that I don&#x27;t do anything, but rather I don&#x27;t do anything to ease the bottleneck, which is currently product development. #1 and I came up with the idea on a phone call a while back and it has become what it is today, so I truly am an original co-founder. It&#x27;s also important to note that #1 and I started another internet company in college which worked out well considering it was a one semester project. We are also best friends.I just got married 2 weeks ago and have a job that I can&#x27;t just bounce back into ever again. My entire family is in the Midwest and there are few good PE shops there. Getting a job in PE is really hard. I believe one in 50 Harvard MBAs can get one, and I was fortunate enought to get one at a good firm in the midwest near my family. So quitting my job is not something I take lightly, but I am open to it. #1 was previously an independent consultant that can easily get a job as good or better within months. He is a tremendously talented developer and I&#x27;m proud to call him my co-founder. When you say \\&quot;risk\\&quot;, I&#x27;m not sure you can compare one man&#x27;s risk of quitting with anothers. Different industry, different pay, different location, different circumstances.  #1 and I had the discussion of what it would take for me to quit on day 1.  I said a significant capital raise (I tossed out $500k-$1mm+) or a really strong user ramp. I spend nearly all my free time (I work a LOT, so there&#x27;s not much) on this startup.  For me to dedictate my only 2 free hours a day to this is a lot, especially considering my recent marriage, but I do it anyway. I would not call this a lack of dedication at all. I&#x27;ve taken 1 C++ class in my life, so convincing me to quit my job to learn to code is a bit far-fetched. We know what we need, we just need the developers to create it, but using me as a developer does not seem like the right decision.I really don&#x27;t think the issue here is that I suck, I think it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m not a developer. Things took longer than expected to get off the ground as far as product developement and #1 is getting antsy, and understandably so. We&#x27;ve gone through several equity-only developers that, in the end, may have taken up more of #1&#x27;s time then they were worth. I&#x27;ve tried getting in touch with the Universities CS departments where #1 lives to try to get some local candidates to get a better startup culture\\/environment going since I&#x27;m in a different location than #1, but there aren&#x27;t many resumes that come across with Ruby experience. If I&#x27;m in the way of making this a success, I&#x27;m willing to do what it takes to remove me as an obstacle. I guess (no offense) I&#x27;m just not convinced that YC and $15,000 is what it takes to make this a success. I think another full-time talented developer that can work with #1 in the same city would do wonders, and I&#x27;m willing to cough up the equity. Now that everyone knows the full story, I&#x27;d be interested to hear some feedback. Maybe the feedback is still that I suck, but at least you have my side of the story. If everyone thinks YC is critical to where we are going and if PG would admit #1 if I stepped down and re-worked the equity I would be willing to do that. The important part is that I&#x27;m a fair, honest, and flexible guy and just want this to be a success. I understand my lack of development is not really helping us right now, but my \\&quot;non-production\\&quot; contributions should not be overlooked either.I apologize for airing our dirty laundry here, but I felt I had to respond once it was up.- #2</td>\n",

I am continuing to work my day job--which can suck up 50-60 hours a week while working on the startup another 16-20 hours a week. Both suck a lot of time away from her. I am definitely concerned about this--especially with a child on the way. But, I have a wonderful wife who understands why I want to start my own company and is nothing but supportive. (Plus, she understands that the path to wealth in the US is not through working for someone else so if she wants to be rich, she has to be willing to take the risk of starting a company.)A lot of people will tell you that a spouse and children will make it more difficult to start, but that is only true if you let it be true. I&#x27;m not saying they don&#x27;t complicate matters, they do. I&#x27;m saying turn your weaknesses into your strengths: family can be a great source of source of support (as other posters have mentioned). Also, when I think about the lessons I want to teach my son, \\&quot;work hard making someone else a lot of money\\&quot; is not something I want him to learn, which means I need to get off my ass and practice what I preach.Regarding how your SO feels about your startup, I think it&#x27;s gonna really depend on where you are in the relationship. Is it new and you want to spend a lot of time together? Or, is it a more mature relationship where you don&#x27;t have to be near each other every waking second. Also, on the SO front, if the your SO wants you to give  up your dreams, there are deeper problems with the relationship that you should consider. Just because your married or in a relationship doesn&#x27;t mean your desires have been sublimated for the sake of the relationship. Bottom line: I see a lot of people telling you why you shouldn&#x27;t start, and they are right--unless it&#x27;s just in you to start, and then nothing can stop you. </td>\n",

I can&#x27;t for the life of me remember the historian&#x27;s name, but his theory seemed to have some merit.His basic argument was that there was a fundamental difference in diets between the two cultures. China was primarily a rice-growing culture, which meant that they needed a large amount of space and irrigation to create paddy fields. Once the rice was grown, it was simple to harvest and the only further treatment it needed to be rendered edible was boiling. All in all, the Chinese culture had quite a low-tech solution to the problem of feeding large amounts of people.On the other hand, rice was not native to Western Europe and impossible to cultivate there anyway. In order to feed its population, European culture grew grains such as wheat, oats and barley, which were not only far harder to harvest but required grinding \\/ milling and baking into bread before they could be rendered edible. Compared to the Chinese rice-based solution, the Western Europe model required a lot more technology. There was, therefore, a much higher demand for technological, engineered solutions to the problem of providing mass sustenance. In turn, this demand led to the adoption of such advances as horse collars, mills, ploughs, crop rotation and horseshoes. All these things were expensive and often required collective solutions.The historian&#x27;s main hypothesis was that the effect of this continual (and necessary) improvement of farming techniques was to engender a culture of engineering in Western Europe. Regardless of where the innovations came from (and they were often cribbed from other cultures, often Middle Eastern) the continual and expensive process of re-engineering farming practices led directly to the development of engineering as a discipline.I really wish I could remember the guy&#x27;s name.</td>\n",

All due respect, Denny, but, not so sure of your policework there.Gartner predicted the demise of the standalone \\&quot;intrusion detection system\\&quot;. Denny&#x27;s product is enabling infrastructure for network monitoring and network security tools. It&#x27;s not an intrusion detection system; it&#x27;s lower on the value chain than that.The market for intrusion detection systems, which are sold almost entirely to enterprises, evaporated in the 3 years following that Gartner report. There were several hundred million addressable dollars of it in 2003. Now there may be 50. You probably don&#x27;t care about this. But what you might care about is, there&#x27;s a difference between bootstrapping a company into a 15MM\\/yr niche and funding a company to go after a billion dollar market. The former has an outcome like nCircle&#x27;s, where you limp for the next 5-10 years of your life. If you do well, you get a \\&quot;lifestyle company\\&quot;. The latter has an outcome like SourceFire, which involves private jets.Lifestyle companies are great. But they don&#x27;t have promising exits. The \\&quot;Paul Graham Way\\&quot; involves exits; murder yourself for 2 years, never work again. This is more the \\&quot;Joel Spolsky Way\\&quot;; end up with private offices, a 4 day work week, and an Aeron chair.We&#x27;ve been bootstrapping for a couple years now. It&#x27;s definitely cost us time, and we have the constant hazard of falling into a lifestyle company. I&#x27;m not saying one approach is better\\/worse than the other.

Once your business is profitable, then you are in control of your own distiny and that&#x27;s why we do STARTUP.Luck is a funny word and everyone can disagree on what it means and whether or not it should be called something else.The bottomline is that when you do startup, there are a lot of things that are really outside of your control.  And if you are hoping that they will come together just right without enduring the hardship and disappointment in between, and it works, then it is just dumb luck and power to you.  But if you work many years and things don&#x27;t work out, but you persevere regardless and then one way, pieces magically fall in place and success is within sight, then you can call it what you want.I call it luck even though I know better.Thanks again for reading my article and for commenting.\\n--Denny--</td>\n",

Your returns will probably be much better over time, although in any given the variance will be much higher. You can&#x27;t do this when you get older because if you need the money and the market has been down three years in a row then you&#x27;re in trouble. The only other thing worth mentioning is that Roth IRAs may be better than traditional IRAs depending on your tax bracket. (And also there are some special retirement vehicles you have access to if you run your own business, though I don&#x27;t really remember the details.)The Malkiel covers some technical stuff, like what it means to invest in assets with a negative beta. (Negative beta securities tend to move against the market, so for example when the index is down gold tends to go up.) However there isn&#x27;t really much reason to invest in these obscure securities unless you&#x27;re running a hedge, so knowing about them is really only good for intellectual curiosity value. </td>\n",

(The software helps find design flaws, does cohort analysis, helps summarize results, etc.)   During that experience, I became very interested in nutrition research as a hobby.  I basically learned that things I grew up eating were unbelievably bad for me.  (I grew up drinking milk, eating meals centered around meat, with lots of refined, fried and sugary ingredients.  Good old Southern cooking and Standard American Diet.)  I also learned that much of what we are taught (\\&quot;Milk for strong bones\\&quot;) is complete bullshit when you actually read the studies.  Milk is really for osteoporosis and breast cancer.We sold that company, and I stopped seriously reading on the subject.  Recently, illnesses in my family (cancer and autoimmune diseases) have caused me to get into the subject again to an even greater degree.  I&#x27;ve also experimented with my own diet for the last several years and I&#x27;ve arrived at a very different conclusion than this fellow.There are tons of people that have an almost religious agenda about pushing specific diets.  They are usually well-intentioned...they just really want to believe they are right.  They publish pseudo-scientific articles like this one that have just enough logic in them to seduce people into believing them.  The media is also horrible about publishing sensational (but poorly analyzed) nutrition research.  They flip-flop their headlines so much (\\&quot;Coffee Can Cure X\\&quot;, then \\&quot;Coffee Causes X Cancer\\&quot;) that people finally just give up on trying to understand nutrition and they just continue eating the crap that they have always eaten.  Which is amazingly sad, because proper nutrition is really the best medicine on earth.I LOOOOOOOVE steak and ice cream, but a vegetarian\\/vegan diet has been shown in almost every study to be a more healthful diet in every respect.  And the studies that fail to show that are usually flawed and\\/or underwritten by industry trade groups.  There is no \\&quot;perfect diet\\&quot; for everyone...there will always be corner cases.  Some people with specific genetic predispositions SHOULD avoid grains altogether.  Apart from gluten sensitivity, there is the issue of molecular mimicry and genetic autoimmune issues, etc. Modern people are dying of heart disease, cancer and strokes, though.  Those illnesses are linked to higher consumption of meat (Paleo-coronary, anyone?), dairy, sugar, cooking oil, and refined foods.  We are NOT dying of starvation, hypothermia, or tooth loss - which were probably some of the more pressing concerns in the paleolithic era.  We are also living 2-4 times longer than our ancestors, on average, so we have entirely different concerns.This is really a fascinating area of research...I&#x27;ve noticed that tons of computer hackers are also very interested in nutrition and body\\/diet hacks.    </td>\n",

Rapid development, deployment.  Serious effort to scale.  Needs a lot of metal.  Database heavy applications require a lot of tooling\\/optimizing, to the point that Rail&#x27;s features for autogen become defeatist at a certain point.Django.  Rapid development, awesome performance, stuck with the Django way or the highway.  Once you get deep into development, the benefit of the rapid development can become a hindrance.  See notes above about Rails.PHP w\\/ MVC Framework.  Rapid development, frameworks not designed for scale, most frameworks designed for a language other than PHP (most seem to think they&#x27;re being written for Java).  Easiest to scale out of the three I&#x27;ve mentioned, not hard to make the framework bend to your needs..NET, if you want to pay licensing fees that could sink your business if you don&#x27;t have the budget.  That said, we chose PHP with PostgreSQL.  We rolled our own framework taking design cues from Rails, ASP.NET and Django.  Foremost built for scale, ease of development second priority.  We run weekly performance comparison with other PHP frameworks, and are able to beat them all by 50% or better; but that&#x27;s because of a design choice for the framework.  We chose performance over ease.  I&#x27;d much rather spend the upfront effort to sleep well at night once launched.  Heavy use of memcache, strict rules regarding use of session, cache at every level (database calls, html fragments, models).  Custom templating for views that incorporates reuse and encapulation principles via ASP.NET\\/JSP style tag libraries\\/controls.That said, PHP sucks.  Horrible hackish language.  But it&#x27;s easy and sleazy, scales easily.  Scaling the database is a separate issue.  MySQL possibly better for this, but PostgreSQL is a better RDBMS on many levels.  Most frameworks for PHP suck because most of the people designing them aren&#x27;t disciplined in other languages and make horrible assumptions about best practices.Flame away.</td>\n",

Plus there is a high probability that I will have to customize the db interaction so much that it may defeat the purpose in the first place.So I&#x27;m leaning towards writing my own PHP+MySQL code from scratch, but I&#x27;m all alone so writing it wouldn&#x27;t be something that seems accomplish-able in 3 months.

The people who had MBAs seemed to be people who hadn&#x27;t started off in trading but came from another career (e.g. computer programming).  The MBA gave them an \\&quot;in\\&quot; at the bank, when they otherwise wouldn&#x27;t have been considered.It seemed like MBAs were more common in traditional investment banking and corporate finance.  The people I knew in IB seemed to think of an MBA as a symbolic, but useful credential.  That opinion may be changing though.Finally, the article was spot on about people who are getting MBAs two years in.  If you did well in your first two years at a bank, you&#x27;re looking at 200k-300k in total compensation.

My title picked on sociology because it seemed like a clearer case, but the quote lumps evolution among the \\&quot;ambiguous sciences\\&quot; as well. I very much agree. I also think that evolution is much more beautiful than anything I&#x27;ve seen in Maths so far.I found it interesting, because it&#x27;s the first time I internalized that ambiguity prevents long chains of arguments, because fuzziness is multiplicative (so to say). As a corollary, if social behavior was not ambiguous, sociology would be potentially just as deep as physics. The quote actually has very little to do with the rest of the book. It was merely a prelude to their discussion on the evolution of societies, which is one of the Major Transitions.The last remark is cool too, \\&quot;it may be that no operative theories are possible in the social sciences\\&quot;, because it applies to biology as well. We do have some operative theories on evolution, but there&#x27;s absolutely no guarantee that every phenomena has a simple holistic explanation. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, we still don&#x27;t have a proof that evolution (Darwin&#x27;s axiom) could lead to complex structures. We just have a lot of very convincing hand-waving.</td>\n",

So current soft sciences plod about trying to gather some type of predictablity in their theories, but often falling back to trying to make causal statements of their experimental observations.I think there&#x27;s been attempts before, like cybernetics, that tries to model human behavior using signal processing techniques.  To my understanding, it&#x27;s since fallen out of favor.  So while it&#x27;s been tried before--and I don&#x27;t know for sure, but my gut says that there probably is mathematics, other than statistics, to bring more analysis into the social sciences.Otherwise, the math just hasn&#x27;t been invented yet.  Currently there are studies in nonlinear systems, complex systems, and math of intervation and manipulation.  My shallowly informed guess is that one of these will help out.Or else we just have to wait for a Physicist to help us out here.</td>\n",

This requires learning and repeated tries, which makes it addicting. Tetris is such kind of game. Very simple but introduces some randomness.\\n</td>\n",

It&#x27;s not like the desktop world where you are launching a year or two from now and can wait for the computers to catch up.  You are launching a month from now and it needs to be fast.  I would prefer to use a web mail client other than GMail, simply because I&#x27;m scared of my Google dependency.  But every other web email client I&#x27;ve used ( Yahoo, Joyent, inbox.com, Zimbra) feels much slower.  Google spends enormous effort optimizing their javascript load times and it really pays off.2)  Broadband speeds are not growing at Moore&#x27;s law.  Terrible regulatory law trumps technological gains.3)  It be hard for a company to lock everyone into its  javascript platform when the entire source code is downloadable.4)  The trouble with javascript is not cross browser incompatibility.  If you use a good library and have learned common gotchas you should not have to spend too much time debugging IE ( I probably spend less than 10% of my javascript coding time on cross browser issues).  The trouble with javascript is that there are still a number of things it just can&#x27;t do, and won&#x27;t be able to do until the browsers change.  For instance, there is no way to detect the exact pixel size of a character of text.  This makes it impossible to build a real word processor in javascript.  Nor can you detect a collision between the opaque regions of two png images (this is needed for most simple 2-d games).  Well ... it&#x27;s almost impossible to do these things.  I suppose you could define your own image and font formats completely in javascript, and render the entire screen using 1 pixel divs.  But that&#x27;s just crazy talk.  It would be a huge library - maybe 250 MB - and would be very slow until computers got faster.  And it would require eating at least 6000 packages of ramen to build the thing.

New books suggested in http:\\/\\/www.librarything.com) - keep up with changes made to each service, handle bugs, quirky codeExtraction layer- synchronise 3rd party added data and client side added data (the \\&quot;add in 1 place\\&quot; bit mentioned). This means being able to either\\/or add data at the client or get the data the user added at the 3rd party site as well and somehow sychronise them- you need tools to extract, manipulate  RSS\\/ATOM feeds. A boon because you don&#x27;t need API&#x27;sMessaging layer- using your abstracted API be able to message various different services\\n and here&#x27;s the hard bit depending on the service. Do you want to send everyone on Twitter a photo update if you have entered 20 flickr photos? - you need to capture store, query, link check and update the various links, metadata and information that message generates. \\nPresentation layer- layering of data. Intelligent hierarchies of data that be queried by other - flexible presentation layers that can export variety of data formats web pages as to XML, RSS files, mobile phone SMS, etc.- flexible presentation layer(s) that can support different levels of information from a complete archive of past posts to their titles or individual tags- metadata ... support things like tags, microformats at a per document level and be flexible enough to allow for more formats that arise.

I once designed pattern recognition software to help recognize skin cancer, so I knew what to watch out for.  Anyway, she had it biopsied and it came back as malignant melanoma - the worst form of skin cancer.  She had surgery to remove it and several of her lymph nodes two days after the diagnosis.  She is cancer free now (PET scan), but it was quite a scare.  She is young and had never had much sun exposure, so we were initially surprised with the diagnosis.  It turns out that some skin cancers are predominantly genetic. And skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, especially among young people.\\/\\/PSA Portion of post\\/\\/Check your skin monthly to see if you have any unusual changes.  As with most cancers, early detection is the key to higher survival rates.  If you notice something unusual, go to a DERMATOLOGIST (not a GP.)  Dermatologists have much better detection rates than regular docs.  My wife had a GP and a surgeon tell her the red mole was nothing, and she only had it removed because I kept nagging her.  Dermatologists measure size\\/penetration etc. with skin cancer to determine survival rates.  My wife&#x27;s survival rate was 85%, but .02mm deeper and it would have dropped significantly.  My doctor had a patient with the same type of melanoma, for example, and she died within three weeks of noticing a new mole.  She took a \\&quot;wait and see\\&quot; approach and it killed her.

Or do you say \\&quot;despite all that, I wish I spent more time with my own family and kids\\&quot; It sounds like this profs answer is the latter. It is humbling since death seems to be such a ultimate leveller. He has certainly led a &#x27;special&#x27; life, spending many years in research contributing to the pool of knowledge for humanity, yet at the end, it is almost like he rediscovered what was more important was something very simple and had nothing to do w\\/ \\&quot;the world\\&quot; or \\&quot;humanity\\&quot;. It was just his family. This is slightly disturbing for me, since I want to make a difference in the world and I do think its important to my life. Will I look back one day, on my deathbed as he is, and discard all of my contributions (or attempts at contributions) as worthless and readily trade it in for just a few more moments with my family? Will i then be overcome with regret that I sacrificed so much to pursue something that meant so little to me? It does give me pause. Perhaps some of my friends, who are not trying to do so much, are the ones who really understand the meaning of life. 2. Changing careers and giving back\\nOn the career side, I agree w\\/ you. Staying in your circle is the best. I have also come to the conclusion that the best way I can help the world is through entrepreneurship and business. I&#x27;m not talented enough to do research. One day I hope to be able to support a professorship for some talented maverick professor who has game changing ideas for humanity but is not &#x27;fundable&#x27; by government programs. I did a successful startup that got acquired by a larger company, and we do software to allow businesses to get better feedback from customers. \\&quot;Whats world changing about that\\&quot; you might say, but the way I talk about it with my customers and my coworkers is that \\&quot;if we do our job right, we are changing the strategy of these multi billion dollar corporations by allowing them to make what their customers want. This touches millions of people in the products\\/services they have available to them\\&quot;. I know, its not like we found the cure for aids. We did not solve global warming. (Definitely a big concern of mine) But we are here at work. And we are here doing this job. Lets make it meaningful, do the best we can, and see if we can&#x27;t help in whatever small way instead of lamenting how we are not doing x or y.  Maybe this will not be enough for me 2 years down the road. But for me, feeling my spine tingle as I explain how much impact our product can have is enough to keep me going for now. </td>\n",

He felt (correctly, it would seem) that he was better at making his capital grow than many other people, and as such, would leave charity to others in the meantime, and give his money later (which he has).The way I think about it is that I&#x27;m confident I&#x27;m better than most people (not news.YC&#x27;ers for sure, but most people) at larger perspectives, or at least feeling confident that I can tackle large problems. It would seem there are (relatively) few people who feel like they&#x27;re in that position, and so I find a need to fill that.What people forget over time (and this I think is what draws out the eye-rolling in general from many people with respect to the above) - is that if they&#x27;re successful, they get caught up in the success and forget about the world changing they intended to do. And if I turn out not to be successful (after repeated attempts) - every failure should bring me closer and closer to tackling world-changing problems head-on.In the meantime, I try to think big, I try to execute big, but I try to pay attention to the smaller details where I can have a positive impact with low opportunity cost.Mainly, I think there&#x27;s a high risk that people lose their idealism and empathy for others in the world over time - and that&#x27;s tough to stave off.</td>\n",

It was pretty frustrating, because no matter how perfect the design was it would require expensive foreign components (like solar panels or small wind turbines) and the solution only prevents the spread of disease when implemented on a large scale. Eventually, I developed an alternative that can be built entirely from local materials. We are finishing the design and hope to built a prototype this December in Peru. This design looks promising and if implemented on a large scale will reduce the spread of waste borne disease like cholera and dysentery. These diseases primarily kill children, long before they have to worry about cancer or aids. (If any of you decimillionaires are interested,  contributions to our composting team through EWB are tax deductible and you can read more about the project at http:\\/\\/pewb.wetpaint.com\\/page\\/Cold+Composting.)[[edit: I know it looks so simple that it can&#x27;t possibly be smart. But, No one is doing anything like this. No one has done anything like this. And the world needs it. ]]We are also developing an inexpensive, distributed sensor network for electrical grids in developing countries that will help reduce theft and downtime. This is nearly complete.We are also developing an inexpensive watch that will make the distribution of complicated AIDS medication to developing, illiterate communities more practical. We are making good progress.Find a problem and fix it. God knows you can. </td>\n",

Noone is worthy or unworthy - what they choose to do with their time and talents are either worthy or unworthy.I am not an ABSOLUTE apologist for capitalism, but I will say that the vast majority of useful tasks have some money in them.  Sure, in some places, it&#x27;s hard to capture the value that you create, but in most areas of inquiry, you can capture the value you create.  Thus, 99% of the time, your expected pay out accurately reflects your expected contribution to society (yes, I am simplifying somewhat).The wonderful thing about a free market is that it channels people&#x27;s talents and labor into those areas that are ACTUALLY useful to other people.I am not convinced that you noodling around, thinking about ID, is of much use at all to society (this is entirely orthogonal to my thoughts on ID - I am commenting specifically on your desire to noodle around).  Your other wide-ranging interests also, without more detail, do not immediately sound like they are of much use to anyone.Now, there may be ways to convert your desire to noodle around into something that is of worth to other people (which means that other people would be interested in paying you for it).A lot of people look at business plans as an arcane exercise, especially because the plan itself is often deviated from quite quickly.  In fact, business plans are tremendously useful as a self-discipling tool: they force you to confront not just what you want to do, but what value people might find in what you want to do, and they force you to tweak your plan until you deliver a noticeably amount of value to others.Your problem here is that you are concentrating JUST on what you want to do.  You have to spend some time thinking about how this creates value for others.  Until you have done that, I do not believe that you would do anything useful with the money, if it were to be handed to you.Funding an intellectual to stare at his navel for 5 years is of not use to anyone (and is barely of any use to the intellectual, who - if he is honest with himself - will look back on the 5 years as wasted, and without result).Funding an intellectual to work on something that sounds useful, on the other hand, makes a lot of sense.Bottom line: stop focusing on yourself, and focus on the value that you&#x27;re going to create.  Once you do that, you&#x27;ll have a real plan that might be deserving of someone else&#x27;s hard earned dollars (after all,if you don&#x27;t want to work for The Man to earn the benjamins, why should someone else who has ALREADY worked for The Man give you his dough, which is to say, the crystalized value of his hours?)\\n</td>\n",

The problem is camber: the side-to-side tilt of the wheel and tire. Bringing the top of the wheel closer to the center of the car is called \\&quot;negative camber\\&quot; while the opposite is \\&quot;positive camber\\&quot;. Most modern cars have a little bit of negative camber, which increases as the suspension is compressed. The relationship of compression to camber is called the \\&quot;camber curve\\&quot;.When the tire is being deformed by cornering forces, negative camber helps more of the tire stay in contact with the road. When traveling in a straight line, negative camber reduces the tire&#x27;s contact with the road and increases tire wear. The reduced contact is visible on the left rear tire in the fourth photo.One solution is to design a suspension with a very fast camber curve and allow minimal compression when cornering. This is similar to what most sports cars already do, and has a couple problems of its own. Such a suspension design is more limited in the distance the wheel can travel upward  and has somewhat less traction on bumpy surfaces.Another solution is to have a separate motor to adjust camber. That&#x27;s expensive and heavy, but would probably work pretty well.</td>\n",

Often times this is because the schema we have in our heads is more broadly defined than the underlying phenomenon.A good example of this is the phenomenon of prodigies. We know there are some people in society who are exceptionally talented in certain areas, and we call these people prodigies. We then have certain schemas that we apply to these prodigies in our quest for wisdom.But even though prodigies clearly exist, our schemas often seem to not hold up so well. For example, studies have shown that child prodigies are often not significantly more successful than the rest of us when they grow up. And similarly, many prodigious adults were completely unremarkable as children. Why is this? How is it possible for such exceptional children not to make anything of themselves, and for such exceptional adults to have been completely average as children?Malcolm Gladwell observes that the reason for this is because when we describe child prodigies, we are describing people who are gifted at learning. Whereas when we describe adult prodigies, we are actually describing people are gifted at doing.Because we are applying one set of sensemaking tools to both groups, our schemas tend to not hold up so well even though they are based on an underlying truth. The solution to this is to create one set of schemas for understanding and dealing with child prodigies, and another set of schemas for understanding and dealing with adult prodigies. There are often areas where we engage in fuzzy thinking, and apply one toolset to multiple distinct phenomena. Philosophers and thinkers can create enormous value by identifying distinct phenomena, and giving suggestions for how to think about each one.PG actually does this in his essay How to Make Wealth. He observes that money and wealth are not the same thing so we should think about them differently. Specifically, that money is sort of an abstraction of wealth, but for various reasons we can benefit from thinking about wealth on a lower level. Providing the sort of disambiguation that this essay does is really valuable, which is why this is arguably the most useful of all the PG essays. It seems like with math we start with something we know is true but not necessarily useful (like just the concept of a line) and then we abstract our way to usefulness. This is opposed to philosophy, which generally takes the stance that all models are false but some models are useful. In philosophy we usually start with something that is useful in certain situations but not necessarily universally true, and then we disambiguate our way down toward truthfulness. I don&#x27;t really see a problem with philosophy as long as it is empirically useful under at least in certain conditions. I feel there are two major issues with philosophy today:1. No \\&quot;philosophical method\\&quot; the same way there is a scientific method, which means philosophy doesn&#x27;t really build on each other from one philosopher to the next.2. No real way to categorize ideas the same way you can categorize physics research, which makes it hard to find prior art. So even though Malcolm Gladwell and PG make really good arguments, there is no guarantee that people in the future will use these arguments. As opposed to science where is something is proven true it becomes the basis for future works.</td>\n",

None of it really makes sense, and is generally nothing more than someone&#x27;s opinion. Yet we hold philosophers such as Aristotle in high regard. Philosophy of science is different from classical philosophy in that it focuses on more concrete aspects. One of the best classes I took was the philosophy of artificial intelligence. We discussed what it is to be conscious, and how we differed from a computer, it at all. Other classes focused on the history of evolution or relativity and studied how these theories were formed and the arguments from the scientific community against them. While a lot of the readings are books or essays by people simply giving their opinions, I&#x27;ve learned to consider what they have to say, but that it is OK and in fact encouraged to disagree and give your own opinion. Since philosophy cannot be \\&quot;proven\\&quot; like a mathematical proof, another&#x27;s opinions are not any more correct than my own as long as both are formed logically. What I took from philosophy was not the opinions of the \\&quot;great philosophers\\&quot;, but rather was the ability to think about things logically and confidently make my own opinions on them.</td>\n",

No one challenged the two until the 1600s.  Kant, by himself, isn&#x27;t a good source since his philosophical agenda was to overthrow the relevance of religion (which was tightly coupled with classical thought).  See Allan Bloom&#x27;s Closing of the American Mind for details.For my undergrad I studied the classics, and I&#x27;d say your generalizations are too general.  People, such as Aristophanes, said the same things about Plato in his day that you say in your essay.  Yet, generations of great thinkers have chosen Plato over the Cynics and Epicureans, today&#x27;s relativists and materialists.  Your critique of the uselessness of philosophy is more indicative of the fact that many of the humanities in academia today are purposely biased towards relativism or materialism.While I agree that philosophy should be tested with practice, I don&#x27;t think practicality should restrict inquiry.  Otherwise, we become very short sighted.  Math is a great example of this, which you&#x27;ve pointed out in one of your essays.

You&#x27;re confusing &#x27;useless&#x27; with &#x27;pointless.&#x27;  All useful activities are done for a specific goal, they aren&#x27;t important in themselves.

No stock ever trades at a P\\/E of 5,000.  1,5,and 10 are plausible P\\/E ratios.  One rule of thumb (advanced by the Motley Fool guys) is that the P\\/E ratio should be about the same as the P\\/E should be around the percentage annual growth (P\\/E\\/G).Anyway, let&#x27;s assume that your startup is going to sell someday for a P\\/E of 5.  That tells us that the price will be 5 times the earnings.So: tell me what you expect your earnings will be at this future date?Let&#x27;s say that you&#x27;re entering a $1 billion\\/yr market, and you expect to grab 10% of it: your revenue will be $100 million.  You expect that of every $100 that enters the company as revenue, 90% will be spent on salaries, Jolt, and Aeron chairs.  So you&#x27;ve got a 10% profit ratio...and on that $100 million of revenue, you expect to earn $10 million of earnings.Jump back to the P\\/E stuff.  If your P\\/E is 5, then you&#x27;ve just described a company that might be worth $50 million.Of course, maybe it would actually be worth $300 million because it&#x27;s a strategic buy for someone else.  Or maybe it would actually be worth $0, because it&#x27;s based on a stupid idea that will be killed by someone else....but that&#x27;s a first stab at the valuation if everything goes right, and the company succeeds wildly, and someone else buys it at a typical P\\/E ratio.There are other valuation formulas, but they tend to boil down to this one at the base (i.e. the demographic coverage, etc. that you mention are ways to figure out total market, or your share of the market, etc.)\\n</td>\n",

First I tried to get various working environments going like:Emacs + Slime + SBCLEmacs + Quack + PLT Scheme\\nI also tried DrScheme (which is a great learning environment).  Not knowing what i&#x27;d really need I also did some searching and discovered a few books:http:\\/\\/mitpress.mit.edu\\/sicp\\/http:\\/\\/www.ccs.neu.edu\\/home\\/dorai\\/t-y-scheme\\/t-y-scheme.htmlhttp:\\/\\/www.gigamonkeys.com\\/book\\/\\ni also purchased the little schemer.  I learned various interesting things from these different sources.1. practical common lisp was essentially useless to me since i&#x27;d already been kind of feeling sold on using scheme and had very little interest in common lisp.  what it DID teach me was how datastructures in lisp are created under the hood (or how one might go about implementing them).  from this perspective it was very nice and helpful when understading, car, cdr and mapcar.  although i wish i&#x27;d had a nice example of implementing  a scheme in C.2. reading The Little Schemer, has been the single most satisfying read of my entire computing life.  so much so\\nthat i bought The Seasoned Schemer and The Reasoned Schemer\\nwithout hesitation at price.  this book will teach you to \\&quot;think lisp\\&quot; if you can just make it through the first book you will honestly know everything you need to about the lisp mindset and be ready to actually write useful code and no be shocked or surprised by anything.  i can&#x27;t stress enough how useful this book is READ IT.3. Teach Yourself Scheme in Fixnum days has been a powerful reference for me and I honestly hope that it grows and evolves, it&#x27;s easy to reference and great for when you start actually hacking on projects.  It&#x27;s just simple and obvious.4. SICP is a mammoth work and also has a very nice video series.  If you&#x27;re serious about Lisp and even more serious about Scheme and furthermore serious about computing.  You must read this.  My approach so far has  been to read top down (ie. cover to cover) and also use it as a reference.  I get sheer joy from reading it, but it&#x27;s amazing how practical it can be as well.Personally I&#x27;ve settled on scheme, i dont&#x27; really like common lisp i find it irritating and with projects like Chicken: http:\\/\\/www.call-with-current-continuation.org\\nout there I feel really comfortable.  I re-wrote my entire\\nblog using nothing but chicken and the web-scheme egg.  I recently wrote an irc bot for fun during a huge bot writing session that broke out in a channel i frequent (don&#x27;t ask we all just started writing bots for some reason).If you&#x27;re looking for good platforms the best I can recommend are:SBCL (hands down nothing really compares so far)PLT Scheme (aka DrScheme if you like GUI&#x27;s)Chicken (the absolute best imho BSD licensed scheme)\\nHope this helps everyone.  This is such an awesome thread i hope it continues for awhile.\\n</td>\n",

I&#x27;ve been picking up bits and pieces, and would not call myself anything near an expert.  I knew what Lisp was from a Languages class in college, and we actually used lisp to implement a language.  Roughly none of it stuck, except for car, cdr, and the idea of using prefix notation and the &#x27;everything is an expression&#x27; idea.  Relearning it started with just reading PG&#x27;s essays and getting curious.  Being too lazy to order it online, I looked in every bookstore and library I encountered for ANSI Common Lisp, but never found it.  It&#x27;s rather pricey, too, which is why I was hesitant.I started with SICP and the video lectures.  Something important came up in another part of my life, though, and I basically put Lisp on hold for several months.  When I finally got settled down again, I started playing with with emacs-lisp.  I knew emacs would be useful no matter what happened next.  I downloaded the manual (which is dense) and scrounged for tips on the internet.  The idea was that I&#x27;d get familiar thinking in that style and using it for practical things, before moving on to something more serious.  Emacs-lisp has some limitations (no closures, for example), so it wasn&#x27;t too long before I started looking elsewhere.My next two sources were On Lisp by Paul Graham and Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp by Peter Norvig.  Both books include speedy overviews of Lisp, and point you to Guy Steele&#x27;s Common Lisp The Language (2nd ed) (CTL2), which can be found online, for authoritative reference.  Both books are good because they are exciting and fun.  Norvig has a fairly gentle introduction, while Graham assumes you&#x27;re already familiar with many Lisp operators.  I don&#x27;t actually think that&#x27;s a big problem, and you shouldn&#x27;t let it scare you away from at least trying to read it.  I think it&#x27;s easier to read the first few chapters of On Lisp first and get excited about looking up the details, than it is to slog through a reference or a mundane introduction beforehand.I&#x27;ve set aside Lisp again, (though I&#x27;m keeping my eye open for opportunities to use it), though I have obtained a copy of ANSI Common Lisp which I also highly recommend.  Even if you don&#x27;t need the introduction, the book includes a large reference section that&#x27;s a bit more &#x27;user-friendly&#x27; than CTL2.  The last significant reference I&#x27;ve used is Practical Common Lisp by Peter Siebel, which can be found online.On Lisp, by Paul Graham http:\\/\\/www.paulgraham.com\\/onlisp.htmlParadigms of Artificial Intelligence:  Case Studies on Common Lisp by Peter NorvigANSI Common Lisp by Paul GrahamThe GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual: http:\\/\\/www.gnu.org\\/software\\/emacs\\/manual\\/html_mono\\/elisp.htm...Practical Common Lisp by Peter Siebel http:\\/\\/www.gigamonkeys.com\\/book\\/Common Lisp the Language: 2nd Edition by Guy Steele http:\\/\\/www.cs.cmu.edu\\/afs\\/cs.cmu.edu\\/project\\/ai-repository\\/a...Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman http:\\/\\/mitpress.mit.edu\\/sicp\\/full-text\\/book\\/book.html</td>\n",

Macros especially feel dense and frivolous before you see them in action. I&#x27;d suggest On Lisp both for being full of excellent examples and free. If you&#x27;re looking at Scheme, then keep SICP by you at all times.Secondly, more so than in other languages, code to learn. Lisp&#x27;s parentheses are a turn off to everyone until they reach some critical mass of application and understanding. Learning Lisp reminds me of learning Chinese: the very medium you write with is vastly different from the norm and rather complex, but as you get into it you learn that there is a whole lot of sense to it.</td>\n",

I knew C, Pascal and Fortran back then, but nothing about Lisp except it&#x27;s a language for AI with full of parentheses.  I was more curious about writing-an-interpreter-in-C part rather than Lisp itself.  At home I typed the C source into my 386 DOS machine, and immediately fascinated by how the simple fundamental idea enabling such a rich language.  (The book is in Japanese and I think out of print.  Probably there are similar books in English, though I don&#x27;t know). Then I went on to reading existing Scheme\\/Lisp implementations and start hacking it.  Aubrey Jaffer&#x27;s SCM gave me a good idea of run-time data representations of Scheme and a simple mark-sweep GC.  I learned how to compile Scheme code by looking the output of Joel Bartlett&#x27;s Scheme-&amp;#62;C.  STk (now stklos) showed the power of CLOS-style metaobject protocol by mapping Tk protocol to Scheme object cleanly like a magic.   Other implementations I looked at was T, VSCM, Scheme48, ...I also started writing tools I use at work in Scheme.  Solving real problems is, after all, the best way to learn the language.\\n</td>\n",

They currently take about 2 weeks to respond to an inquiry (in broken English) and you then have to give them you CC# and commit to a monthly minimum and wait another 3 weeks before you can try the service.

If you expect everybody that you come across in cheaper countries to be 100% efficient and as intelligent as everybody else in the world then rest of the world is really cooked.

This could be a difficult task especially for foreigners because they have no or little idea about the country\\/people they are outsourcing to. Some ideas for getting the right resource: \\n1) Use any Indian connections you may have. I am sure a lot of them will have connections back home. This is your best option.\\n2) Use your LinkedIn connections.\\n3) Hang out in newsgroups\\/mailing lists and watch out for people who answer questions. They are generally good.\\n4) Use communities like news.yc and slashdot. Some communities attract bright people and some of them could be Indians.

Why?  Because resume that Steve recommends will keep you from getting a job doing java for the accounts recievable department of a big corp, and the resume that will get you that big corp java job will prevent you from getting an interview with Steve.  Big corps are, first and foremost, looking for a pliable, good natured person who will follow directions and largely do as told.  Within that context, they&#x27;d like as much talent as they can get, but they aren&#x27;t willing to break the obedience requirement to get it.  Negative indicators for a big corp are: contributions to open source projects, an interesting an opinionated blog, microISV work, startup experience, substantial side work, passion for (or borderline obsession with) \\&quot;obscure\\&quot; programming languages (like LISP, ruby, smalltalk...)  These things show that you might be trouble.  Positive indicators for bigcorp are: buzzword bingo resumes, weasel words, long lists of mainstream programming languages, databases and operating systems (like Java, C#, VB, MSSQL...), vendor certification in the above list.  These things suggest to the big corp that you&#x27;ll play their game the way they like it played.It turns out that you can&#x27;t really cover both bases, which is why I call this speciation.  We&#x27;re rapidly moving toward a point where these two groups will no longer be able to interact or cross-pollinate.  You can&#x27;t be a bigcorp programmer and an innovative hacker at the same time, any more than you can be a sea cucumber and a clownfish the same time.  One excludes the other.

The idea was that programmers would define objects, and the database would provide persistence for the objects.  It was (and still is) a nice idea.Rails took a completely different approach, embracing the RDBMS as the model itself.  Rather than creating objects and pushing the design out to the RDBMS, you define the relational structure and allow Rails to extract an object model.  If you are doing basic CRUD operations, you may not have to think about SQL again, even in a reasonably complicated app, and the syntax is very clean.I just love it.

The difference in nominal units is some of the basis of the impedence mismatch.Think about what it takes to do something interesting with a collection of objects in c++\\/java\\/whatever, such as pick out  the subset that have a cost&amp;#62;n: it is a loop over the entire set.  Ruby makes it prettier and cleaner, but you&#x27;re still just looping.  Unless you create a custom collection class that internally stores a hash organized by costs.  But the creation of the new class is extra overhead because the nominal unit is the single object.The counterexample is just as instructive.  To retrieve the newest 10 entries in a blog uses the LIMIT syntax in SQL, which is painfully nonstandard: http:\\/\\/troels.arvin.dk\\/db\\/rdbms\\/#select-limitThings that are simple in one space are hard in the other.In my own work I&#x27;ve resolved some of this by attempting to avoid abusing the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; ORM tools that are out there that allow designing queries in your language of choice (Rails for Ruby, Hibernate for Java).  Instead, I attempt to figure out exactly what I need out of query: how to structure the SQL to give me back the exact set of data I care about. No subsequent looping in Ruby\\/Java allowed.That forces a line in the system between the DB and the application code where each is able to be use its nominal units in as native a way as possible.</td>\n",

It&#x27;s definitely not because we don&#x27;t know the relational theory (I beg your pardon, but screw relational theory, it&#x27;s as ugly as DBs themselves).One problem I can think of is that I&#x27;m forced to mix two languages in one story (a program, that is). It&#x27;s like writing an essay in English over-peppered with a lot of Latin phrases and sayings. In web development it gets even worse: as if my favorite programming language X plus SQL wasn&#x27;t enough, I mix up HTML, CSS and JavaScript - that&#x27;s at least 5 languages in total!Another problem is that from a programmer&#x27;s perspective databases are, put simply, arrays possibly with pointers. The only reason we can&#x27;t declare these structures as arrays\\/lists with pointers is that data can grow infinitely big and my favorite language X can&#x27;t handle that. In other words, using databases is a classical example of premature optimization that comes at a price of overcomplicated code.    Yes, databases are plain arrays and even the best relational advocate can&#x27;t prove the opposite (or I&#x27;d be glad to hear arguments actually).Upd: persistence and a possibility to share data between processes is another reason we use databases, but I&#x27;m sure there are more elegant ways of doing this.</td>\n",

Maybe it&#x27;s called hindsight, or some type of reflective process.Does the unconscious mind adopt &#x27;regret&#x27; only at specific times, that is, after making a choice? As an idea to improve emailing, maybe an email client that renames the send button draft 1 then draft 2 then draft 3 before ever showing &#x27;send&#x27;. Also, there would be a time delay buffer to stop one&#x27;s overriding of that &#x27;delayed sending&#x27; feature through pressing the button 3 times rapidly in succession. The idea could even be implemented as a Thunderbird addon if one was serious about it, or a greasemonkey script.Also, I like Digg&#x27;s submission process of giving 90 seconds to change a posting before it is made permanent, that is, after pressing the &#x27;post&#x27; button - it kind of adds a type of pressure which some people need to improve their output given the feature allows textual changes to be made in that time.Ultimately, the need to proof read and reflect on any written communication multiple times without others&#x27; feedback can be a test of one&#x27;s patience and tenacity.

But he said this lack of time was the greatest gift to the development of Basecamp. It helped focus his view on what they needed, and it forced them to make tough decisions about making less software all the time. When you have a lot of time you just get tempted to try to do it all, or at least do too much.

Bear in mind that I have one and half year old kid who takes lot of time away from me (Off course I enjoy it a lot).\\nRecently two more friends joined me and we are pretty confident on launching in November.Based on my experience I can say that, persistence is what matters. If you work full-time and are not persistent or loose focus then you are not going anywhere. If you work part-time and are persistent and focussed then you will win.  May be it will take more time than usual but you will get there with better results.So I would say, yes go ahead and work part-time on your idea, but be very persistent to spend whatever extra time you find on the idea.\\nIt would be good idea to find group of friends who can work part-time with you.

Here is why I built it:With the big social news sites: Digg, reddit, and recently after the name change, news.yc, the discussions tend to become more general as the communities grow because we, the readers, have different interests. And because of that, only what&#x27;s common to everyone goes to the top. Smaller communities have more focus, but it&#x27;s hard for them to survive because there is less to read, and therefore, we tend to visit them less often and eventually forget about them.I&#x27;m trying to solve this by keeping the communities smaller and focused, but allow the individual reader to choose the communities they like and I create a custom page for them where they only see what they&#x27;re interested in. This way, even though the individual communities might have low volume of stories, the reader will always find something interesting to read in one of his communities or the other. It&#x27;s like how an RSS reader allows us to keep track of low volume blogs because we don&#x27;t have to remember to visit each one of them.</td>\n",

Your site looks awesome, so if enough of it works to pull together a great demo, then you can raise money.  But, if development is what you want, you might want to bring in a co-founder...a great coder costs more than a small investment will buy, but equity in a great idea can buy great developers.  You seem quite capable of holding up your end of the bargain, so you should have hackers knocking on your door...just pick the smartest of them, and run this idea up the flagpole.  (You might still want to raise money, but not so much for development.)</td>\n",

I would suggest marketing it to companies and corporations since they have multiple computers and a desire to understand computer usage.If you can get some funding I would suggest 1. Create a CD-Rom that you can mail out, similar to the \\&quot;Free AOL\\&quot; cd-roms we all used to get.  This will make your product tangable and into the hands of companies that are not tech saavy enough to search you out on the web but do want to track computer usage. (who wouldn&#x27;t want it, I see this as something that any company would want if they knew about it).  2.Here is a mailing list program http:\\/\\/www.completefinancialmarketing.com\\/-p-284.html so you can reach all of these customers that would never find you otherwise.  When I used to fix computers for a living, I meet all sorts of companies that spend a lot of money on IT and the company owners were really non-technical.  You can&#x27;t really reach these people with web marketing but you can directly and from my experiences they would be very open to this type of product.3.  If your program doesn&#x27;t track multiple computers, that would be really key.  I only looked at it briefly.  Essentially you would need a master account that can see the stats from multiple accounts.  Not really hard, you probably already have that.\\n</td>\n",

None hit it big.\\n\\nSo earlier this year the guru of Silicon Valley start-ups decided to fund a really dumb idea that cost as little as possible.In May, Kawasaki started Truemors, a site specializing in what it calls \\&quot;true rumors\\&quot; submitted by readers. It cost less than $13,000 to launch and was almost immediately dubbed \\&quot;the worst site ever\\&quot; by a leading European technology news site.Why would a respected venture capitalist and author of bestselling business books make a site like Truemors his next act? Because Kawasaki, 53, wanted to get firsthand experience with a user-generated, Web 2.0, social-media Web site.He also felt that starting the site would illustrate what he saw as a problem with venture capital - these Web 2.0 sites did not need lots of funding, and even if they did it was becoming harder for VCs to pick the winners.For nine years, Kawasaki and his partners had invested millions of dollars in companies that seemed like smart bets. They had their share of successes, but nothing on the order of Google or Yahoo.Meanwhile, ideas he dismissed became stock market sensations.Like Yahoo. In 1995, venture capitalist Michael Moritz of Sequoia Capital asked Kawasaki if he&#x27;d like to interview to be chief executive of Yahoo. \\&quot;It was a list of David and Jerry&#x27;s (co-founders Filo and Yang) favorite Web sites,\\&quot; Kawasaki recalled. \\&quot;It had no business plan.\\&quot;Kawasaki said no. Years passed. Two guys from Stanford created yet another search engine. \\&quot;The 15th search engine - what a dumb idea,\\&quot; Kawasaki quipped about his reaction. That turned into Google.\\&quot;The only thing you can conclude is that it&#x27;s a crap shoot,\\&quot; Kawasaki said in a recent interview at his home office in Atherton. \\&quot;You have no idea what is going to succeed.\\&quot;Bill Reichert, Kawasaki&#x27;s partner at Garage Technology Ventures, said the tipping point for his partner came after Kawasaki chaired a panel discussion featuring start-ups like Hot or Not - a Web site where men and women submit photos to be rated by strangers - and Plenty of Fish - a free dating site.Neither site had raised venture capital, but both were enjoying advertising sales of more than a million dollars a year. That made it clear to the folks at Garage that the problem was the venture capital model itself, which seemed out of whack.Kawasaki decided to find out how little it cost to start a Web 2.0 company himself. He paid $4,500 to Web developers in South Dakota whom he had met through his personal blog. He spent $4,824 on legal fees. He spent almost $3,000 more on a logo, domain names and other miscellaneous expenses.And he began devoting himself to what he truly loved: Selling products and ideas.At Apple Computer in the 1980s and 1990s, Kawasaki had helped turn Macintosh users into Apple fanatics. He left the company in 1997, and made a career as a venture capitalist and speaker. His book \\&quot;The Art of the Start\\&quot; became a bible for would-be entrepreneurs.Some of his key advice: \\&quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid of polarizing people,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Don&#x27;t let the bozos grind you down.\\&quot;Two days after he launched Truemors, Kawasaki discovered the value of his own advice.Kawasaki had wanted the site to be a place where news and gossip met. He imagined his average reader as a Google programmer who was about to go on a date with an East Bay non-profit activist.What would they talk about? Truemors could help. Its news items covered everything from politics to sports, Hollywood gossip and technology culled from the Web and, occasionally, firsthand accounts.\\&quot;I promise, if you read Truemors, it will make you a more interesting person,\\&quot; Kawasaki said.Unlike Digg, a similar user-generated site that lets people rank stories on its front page, Truemors lists stories in the order they were submitted. Users can vote to move a story to a \\&quot;Greatest\\&quot; page - or to the dumpster if they think something is untrue.The blogosphere&#x27;s first reaction to Truemors was a blistering attack. A hacker broke in. Obscenities were submitted as news. Kawasaki himself was trashed.\\&quot;I have a very low opinion of the blogosphere,\\&quot; Kawasaki said. \\&quot;I think it is made up of about 250,000 people who are mostly 45-year-old men who live with their mother and have dead cats in their refrigerators.\\&quot;Kawasaki didn&#x27;t let the bozos get him down. He cleaned up his site. The attacks quickly died down.Earlier this month, the European news outfit with the scathing early review recanted. \\&quot;We&#x27;re big enough to admit that Truemors is definitely not the world&#x27;s worst Web site any longer,\\&quot; Martin Veitch, executive editor of IT Week, wrote in a Sept. 10 article on theinquirer.net, a technology news site.Kawasaki said the coverage was responsible for a huge spike in page views, which are now averaging about 150,000 a month, according to Google analytics.Drew Curtis, founder of FARK, a Web site of interesting and amusing news stories that was one of Kawasaki&#x27;s inspirations, said those numbers are pretty good. He said FARK, which now gets 53 million page views a month, got only 50,000 page views in its first year. FARK was launched in 1999.\\&quot;He certainly has critical mass,\\&quot; Curtis said of Kawasaki.Kawasaki insists he wants the site to be a success, but he acknowledges that the stakes are not high. His monthly break-even point is only $3,000.Kawasaki is still a venture capitalist and continues working with Garage&#x27;s portfolio of companies. \\&quot;Truemors helps me understand Web 2.0 better than any other experience,\\&quot; he said. \\&quot;Life is good for entrepreneurs these days.\\&quot;</td>\n",

And it&#x27;s not at all Web 2.0 or constantly new.  Our business website even gets 100k page views per month (similarly, 1000-1500 visitors per day), and we definitely don&#x27;t consider that a triumph.I&#x27;m not begrudging him success with Truemors.  I, unlike a lot of folks here, think very highly of Kawasaki.  I found his books inspiring and occasionally educational, and his Art of the Start presentation is awesome.  But I think it&#x27;s too early to call it a success at 150k page views per month...the 250k users thing doesn&#x27;t quite gibe with the 150k page views...that would mean that almost no one EVER comes back to Truemors after their first visit, which is a very bad thing.</td>\n",

It should be easy to close a reasonably small loan quickly, you don&#x27;t have to give up any equity or worry about people trying to control what you do, and if you are in the position where you feel like a short-term loan is enough to get you over the hump to revenue, then you are probably on the path to success.I do have two suggestions, however:1. Get your partner in on the loan somehow, too. No matter how much you trust him\\/her, it&#x27;s not really fair to you to expect you to take all that risk while your partner takes on none.2. Reassess your situation and set reasonable expectations. How long will a loan last for? Is that long enough to finish the brunt of the work? How long until you start getting positive revenue (are you sure about your prospective customers)? With all those factors in mind, is the loan a smart way to proceed (i.e. an 80% chance that nothing will go wrong)?</td>\n",

Not only can debt ruin your life if the startup fails, but a lot of debt can look bad on your books if you reach the point of looking for outside investment.I recently learned about Certified Capital Companies (CAPCOS), which are government backed organizations that look like banks, but their investment turns into equity like an Angel or VC investment. Apparently they are still very conservative in their investments though, and may not have very desirable terms. But at least this is better than taking on a lot of debt.

It seems very closely related to the decline of waterfall and the rise of iterative development.It&#x27;s really important that we (the people who believe in prototyping and iterative development) emphasize that this is not a chaotic way to approach a problem.  We absolutely do plan - however, we plan by coding and prototyping, rather than writing detailed specs.  Specs are good - but they emerge from the code and the prototype.  We absolutely do consider design issues - however, we discover and implement these things through refactoring.  And in the end, we may very well throw out our first approach and rewrite, if it appears to be necessary.But I think this is leaving the realm of opinion and entering the realm of reality. The people who try to do the pure waterfall where an architect designs and writes specs, a coder writes code, a tester does testing - they seem to be losing badly in the race to get excellent software to market.

Whenever you write a bit of code, you probably do something to check whether it is producing the expected outcome - even if it is as simple as writing a little script to generate some output that you visually inspect as it flashes by on the screen.  If it looks good, you keep developing.  If it fails, you figure out why.  Just store your these mini-testing scripts in a unit test, and verify the expectation\\/output in a short statement.  If you use a framework, you&#x27;ll have some methods for this available to you - if you don&#x27;t, no biggie, just write something that honks loud and gives you a message diagnosing the failure.  It&#x27;s not going to satisfy the TDD crowd, and honestly your coverage won&#x27;t be as good as if you had done TDD, but there you go - you just got yourself some unit tests, and you didn&#x27;t have to disrupt the mental flow that you prefer to TDD.  </td>\n",

Their colour literacy stays that of a four year old and worse as they will not experiment it probably degrades from there. So what is the quickest way to re-learn colour and colour combinations? Go outside and observe natural colour combinations.   Combine these observations with a bit of theory and experimentation and you can be on your way creating your own colour combinations.

My day job is as an ER nurse (while I finish my CS degree), and it&#x27;s totally the way I&#x27;d go for my medical care if there was someone around that did this.Some doctors with a boutique practice take a retainer fee plus bill insurance.  Sounds like this guy is going the cash only route.  I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll end up making more money that way, regardless.  The average GP in NYC probably makes about 120,000 - 150,000.  But they have to carry a 5,000-10,000 patient load while each patient gets 15 minute appointments.  Some docs routinely see over 20 patients a day.  This guy is charging a $500 retainer for two visits a year.  That means that if he has 300 patients, he&#x27;s making what a regular GP makes at an HMO.  If each patient has two visits a year, that means that he can have 2 appointments a day and make the same amount as an HMO doc.  That&#x27;s his break even point.  Anything over that, and it&#x27;s gravy.  I&#x27;m willing to bet that he has a 500 patient load.  So, he&#x27;s bringing in $250,000 net plus extra visits and appointments.  So, by going cash only, he&#x27;s probably making twice what an insurance doc would make.    This guy also does house calls only. So, he doesn&#x27;t have the overhead that he&#x27;d normally have with an office--staff, office rent, equipment, etc...  He doesn&#x27;t have to hire billing specialists.  He outsources all of his X-Ray and lab work, so no overhead there.  And, he has an unofficial network of non-jerk specialists that he can refer people to that he likes working with.  I&#x27;m surprised that this hasn&#x27;t caught on more than it has.  If you&#x27;re his patient, look at his appointment schedule.  He&#x27;s giving people a half-hour to one hour time slots.  And, he does a lot of his consultations over the wire, via IM, video chat and cell phone.  He probably doesn&#x27;t have to see his patients most of the time, and it&#x27;s a lot easier for his patients to get in touch with him.  His patients are happier and he has a much better quality of life.  Brilliant.</td>\n",

So talking about equity is just weird with them because they don&#x27;t want to give any up (no matter how much their website looks like Geocities).\\n2) I hate having to explain the \\&quot;long tail\\&quot; over and over when I&#x27;m trying to explain a wholly different concept. The buzz takes time to reach the East.\\n3) Although accessibility to capital is generally based on good referrals, it&#x27;s more difficult in the East because those circles are much tighter.\\n4) We heard from a good advisor that just being in the Silicon Valley will always improve your chances of success, but we moved out to DC because we&#x27;re working in the \\&quot;political sphere.\\&quot; I don&#x27;t have any reference for comparison, so I don&#x27;t exactly know what to say about that.\\n5) That said, since we spend a lot of time inside programming, it probably isn&#x27;t as different if we were somewhere else. I think as a result of the internet, you can still make quite an impact, but closing a business deal is so much easier when it&#x27;s in person.</td>\n",

It brings to mind PG&#x27;s counter-example of the iPod to the \\&quot;Squalor of the man-made bits of America\\&quot; (in his Made In USA essay).  When I lived in Europe, I noticed that general stereotypes of the \\&quot;USA\\&quot; differed dramatically from impressions of \\&quot;LA\\&quot;, \\&quot;San Francisco\\&quot;, \\&quot;New York\\&quot;, \\&quot;California\\&quot;.  When you say \\&quot;USA\\&quot;, people around the world often think of an economic and military juggernaut.  If you say \\&quot;California\\&quot;, they often think \\&quot;surfers, technology, Ahnold, the Golden Gate Bridge,\\&quot; and so forth.  Various cities in the US also have their own international reputations.  It&#x27;s pretty clear that the rest of the world has very negative and very positive impressions of the United States, and these can be triggered by how you present yourself.  Perhaps Apple is trying to grab a more positive reaction by claiming California rather than the USA?  When Bush refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, there was some talk in England about boycotting US products (pretty hopeless idea there, but it shows the anger).  California did raise its international brand by bucking that trend.  I expect the US will regain some of its stature once the current administration is gone, but even if\\/when it does, I&#x27;d expect more local branding.   Cities compete with each other more than countries do.  What does it even mean to say it was \\&quot;Made in the USA\\&quot; anymore?  If it&#x27;s made in Seattle, Sydney, or Barcelona, it isn&#x27;t made in San Francisco.  We may be moving toward a world economy where that&#x27;s the only thing that actually matters.  </td>\n",

And it turned out neither Atari nor Amiga inherited the future of computing - nobody made games for Atari ST anymore. I got a 286 12 running DOS 3 from my mum, and was plunged into boot disk hell trying to free that precious 640K of RAM for my games. I started editing batch files and using &#x27;errorlevel&#x27; to make little menus so I could use less floppies (they were expensive). Then I had a 386 where the video card slipped out all the time. So I opened the case and slipped it back in. I eventually got a feel for hardware.The computer teachers at high school were terrible. I didn&#x27;t like logo, as I couldn&#x27;t see anything practical. We learnt Pascal later, but the teacher was always away, so we learnt from the internet and another kid who showed us.

I&#x27;m actually really glad I got into Linux then, and I&#x27;m glad I stuck with it. At that time, everybody was talking about Win32 and Visual Studio. It seemed like you had to have an MSDN subscription to make software that was considered desirable by the masses.

The program I wrote was a small AppleScript application that registered an \\&quot;av\\&quot; protocol with Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer so you could type \\&quot;av:knitting patterns\\&quot; in the Location bar and have that string sent to the AppleScript applet. The script received the string, looked for what came after the \\&quot;av:\\&quot; and computed a full URL to send it back to the web browser. The whole process was invisible to the user, as long as the AppleScript applet was running in the background.It was a very simple script and I released it as shareware. I later built a search plugin architecture so users could add their favorite search engines, and the whole experience was a huge lesson in programming, testing, documentation, distribution, customer support and marketing, and I was suddenly buried in work.Then Apple developed a plugin architecture for Sherlock and I started getting fewer and fewer shareware registrations. That&#x27;s what essentially killed my shareware product, but the entire experience was very exciting. I was hooked and have been hacking ever since.</td>\n",

Communication is a fundamental, it is the reason. Second there&#x27;s the big draw cards of social networks - an easy lightweight way to connect and reconnect. Its a great big people directory - and connections are very low social risk - much easier than emailing that person you haven&#x27;t seen in years. And how are you going to get their email address anyway, any public directory would be spam central.Of course myspace or any site has that much going for it. So that leaves the final facebook draw card - facebook apps. I totally understand the skepticism, but apps offer lots of different shared activities. Lots of little quizzes and games, very much like the kind of structured getting-to-know-you party game type activities. Its actually very difficult for these kinds of applications to exist without incorporating the friend networks that facebook offers. Its a platform that allows a kind of lightweight, asynchronous and with easy opt-outs and opt-ins, shared online experience. I think it actually threatens to become the internet for a lot of people. </td>\n",

I wanted to be a VFX artist.  I was starting to put together a decent portfolio of some stuff I&#x27;d done.  Then I made some friends who worked in the VFX industry, and I realized how much the life of an FX artist sucked.  So, shortly after I got my first offer to work for an FX firm, I decided to leave town.  One of my friends,  (he teaches FX at Sony Imageworks now) told me:  The guys at Imageworks who have the most creative freedom are the programmers.  The artists have to reproduce what someone else tells them to reproduce for 16 hours a day, 6-7 days a week.  The programers write code whatever way they want to as long as the code gets the job done.So, I picked up a copy of Hackers and Painters, left LA and enrolled in a CS program.  That was 3 years ago.  I&#x27;ve been plugging away at school ever since.  I&#x27;ve since moved to the Bay area, I&#x27;m finishing my degree in two more semesters, and I&#x27;ll finally have a go at my startup.  I agonized and complained for months after I read Hackers and Painters because I couldn&#x27;t hack and I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d ever be able to. I was intimidated.  But, then I figured if I didn&#x27;t take the leap and dive in, I&#x27;d still be whining about it months or years from now.  So, if you&#x27;re upset that you don&#x27;t fit in in hacker culture, and that your not a hacker... Maybe you&#x27;re trying to tell yourself something.  Maybe what you really want to do is learn how to hack.  It&#x27;s what I wanted all along.  I just didn&#x27;t know it.</td>\n",

The reason why so many people lost their shirts in the first bubble was because millions of Joe Averages took out cash advances or cashed out home equity to buy Internet stocks.  There was a lot of hubris around the NASDAQ and average investors jumped in on the action en masse.  I personally knew at least 4-5 people who had left their jobs to become day-traders.  I worked with a Med student who had maxed out 8-10 credit cards, bought high tech stocks with them, and then bought a collection of motorcycles with his stock earnings.  When the bubble popped, he was left with a bunch of loans on expensive motorcycles, $100,000 in credit card debt and a great position on worthless Pets.com stock.  Sarb-Ox has really clamped down on the number of IPO&#x27;s that are occuring now.  So, even though there might be hubris around web apps right now, the average investor has no way of pumping money into those businesses, and that&#x27;s a good thing.  What start-ups are creating are several products in tandem:  The first is software that actually does stuff.  The second is a community of users that develop and grow around that software product.  The third is a small tight-knit group of people who have proven their capacity to produce.  Big Co is interested in all three of those things.  And Big Co has proven repeatedly that they are willing to shell out a bunch of cash to aquire the software, the community or the people.  Even if the startup isn&#x27;t profitable, the software, community and people are still very valuable to companies that need those things.  What start-ups aren&#x27;t creating this time around is IPO fever where the stock price gets ramped up while the founders and employees cash out.  This is what&#x27;s going to prevent the next big bubble from forming around web apps for quite a while this time around.  The fundamentals are much better this time around.</td>\n",

When I lived there, it was very very hard to find technical people that were not \\&quot;corporate drones\\&quot;. I new maybe of only one or two startup (I am not sure they ended up anywhere). Most other companies are \\&quot;enterprise oriented\\&quot;, such as VM-ware types. I remember attending few session at an incubator close to MIT campus. The speeches were given for people that had build products like \\&quot;scanners\\&quot; for airports, and government etc.. not software oriented One thing I remember, this guy from HBS, with a very smug attitude ( maybe b\\/c he got into haavad he thought he was better than everybody). Not a hacker friendly atmosphere at all. Most people there were the \\&quot;business\\&quot; types, that had \\&quot;ideas\\&quot; and buzzwords, but very low on concrete implementation and treated technical skills just as a commodity that could bought off in India. \\nBoston is not \\&quot;eccentric\\&quot; and \\&quot;whacky\\&quot; enough to support an environment with lots of startups with crazy and novel ideas.\\nHere is few facts: You don&#x27;t see naked people in the streets on Boston&#x27;s fairs. It is mostly family\\/9-5-er or young students, which tells you about the general population of the place. If you are in your mid 20s, and out of school, it is not a good place to be. You can&#x27;t buy alcohol on Sundays You can&#x27;t have wine\\/beer in a coffee place (Puritanism at max) Most coffee\\/food places around Harvard sq. and Davis sq (the artsy part) closed by MIDNIGHT!!! WTF? Most good programmers I know are most efficient at midnight, and having things\\/places to get \\&quot;fuel\\&quot;, (coffee and food) and some re-energizing is very important.\\nFor many reasons, I think NYC would be a better place for a startup, if it wasn&#x27;t so damn expensive, which kills ideas that have no business model right away.  But as a place is very vibrant, lots of stuff to do, good looking women, and lots of money around, which are motivators for people to try harder and make it happen.\\nThe only thing that the Boston\\/Cambridge are has is it&#x27;s student population. -- which not surprisingly moves out somewhere else after school, and that it is a very walk-able city.  You can walk to places, take the T  (subway), which is very cool.\\nPersonally, I like SF a lot,  but I would never live in the South Bay.  All those seas of parking lots and the \\&quot;drive everywhere\\&quot; culture is very depressing and soul drenching.  Efficient for big corporations like HP and Yahoo,  but I can&#x27;t see it being good for a small start up.   \\nMy preference for startups:  SF beats them all.  NYC second (if it wasn&#x27;t so damn expensive), but it has bonus point for being so close to the old media advertising, then Cambridge\\/Boston (for having so many college kids around).\\nI think, Eastern Europe is going to become more prominent in the IT world.  You have lots of smart and well educated people at sciences, still cheap, and with a good sense of entrepreneurship  (unlike India or China, which see life more as a career, eastern europeans are new to capitalism, and view this time as a great opportunity).   It will take a decade or so, but you will see more things coming out from places like Hungary, Croatia, Romania etc.  I doubt it will ever be a single large European \\&quot;hub\\&quot;.\\nEdited for spelling, and adding some content.\\n</td>\n",

Going with python\\/perl\\/C# would have saved us time on memory leaks and some of the crashing (no buffer overruns etc). The downside would be that the server may be slower. BUT the cost to develop the C++ server was about the cost of 40 servers so we could have written a slower app that scaled and bought more servers and rackspace. I estimate choosing c++ added about 6-8 months to the task. Even as I left, while relatively stable the code is brittle and there is only one engineer left who knws the code and he is too chicken to change anything. Launch pressures meant there was &#x27;not time&#x27; for unit tests (plenty of time to dig a large hole though)Think hard about your requirements. Most severs spend most of their time waiting. Either the filesystem, database or on high load reading from memory\\/swap. So the CPU is often under utilised. Interpreted languages while slower can give a similar performance profile to c\\/c++ but with more cpu utilisation. When you have a LOT of sockets open you can spend a lot of time waiting for the kernel to poke you (even with kqueue or io completion ports).Either way, don&#x27;t write the underlying server code yourself there are frameworks in ALL languages that will get you 90% of the way. Remember scalability is a &#x27;nice&#x27; problem to have as it means you have customers. Concentrate more on scaling across more machines as they are a LOT cheaper then engineering times.good luck</td>\n",

If it requires a lot of CPU time, you&#x27;ll probably want a language that compiles to native code.  Lots of choices there so look for the most productive one given your performance constraints.Is your application highly distributed, or in need of fault tolerance outside of the database?  Erlang might be an ideal fit.  Can you build the entire thing out of Java libraries? Then Java&#x27;s probably your best bet, but...If you&#x27;re building something and expecting tons of of concurrent users then you&#x27;ll probably have to write most of the code from scratch.  So keep that in mind when picking a language. Client Side If your client is very GUI-based then most cross-platform toolkits may not feel native enough.  You might want to consider writing writing separate clients for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, If a purely native feel isn&#x27;t necessary, you could use your favorite scripting language and GTK+, or wxWindows, or QT.  Or Java and Swing or SWT.If you have a unique, or web-like, GUI then maybe Mozilla&#x27;s XULRunner would be a good choice.</td>\n",

The roomba API is completely open: anyone with a serial cable and some know-how can control it. The ConnectR should eventually be open as well.I&#x27;d like to see this taken to the next level with live-casting from a robot. Justin.tv meets ConnectR.The robot would either have to be managed by a human when in public, or it could wander alone in a private space. Community voting could control where the robot goes and whhere it directs its gaze. Ideally, the robot would be placed where average people can&#x27;t be, like back stage at a concert or fashion show. Dangerous places are also ideal. Let the robot go where the humans shouldn&#x27;t.\\nRobots with internet enabled cameras can do more than normal robots. Server-side processing means the robot doesn&#x27;t need to have expensive hardware on board for the intelligence.Obstacle avoidance, mapping, localization, face &amp;#38; pedestrian detection, object detection, object tracking &amp;#38; motion modeling, etc. can all be done using today&#x27;s technology with a single camera stream. Some processing would need to be local given the constraints of network bandwidth, but plenty could be offloaded. It is also a good model for premium services: pay more to get faster connections, fast processing, and more capabilities.Automated surveillance with alerts for intruders could be a killer-app for wifi\\/webcam robots. Today&#x27;s choices for home security are immobile, cost thousands, or both.\\nServer side image processing itself is a viable idea. It&#x27;s the next step in online video. Today, we just stream compressed pixels. Tomorrow, we&#x27;ll calculate and stream information about the scene. You can send a flickr image stream to a service which finds faces, builds a corpus of data to identify the people from context, and performs face recognition. Face recognition companies like Animetrics could be tapped to do the hard part.Motion detection for surveillance applications could all be online, with companies like Intellivid and ObjectVideo already having optimized the image processing component.Street Views in maps can be combined with GPS tagged digital camera shots to build super high resolution aerial imagery, and eventually 3D.Services like Fauxto which aim to be photo-shop online could build an interesting api where any image can be sent with instructions for processing.The point is that all of these services require sending video and images to a server, where some intelligent processing occurs. Often times, the processing will involve the same software modules, so each problem is not unique. Tap the long tail of software development and allow 3rd parties to build their own processing streams that live on your servers. This could be made simple and standard using tools like Python with modules for image processing like OpenCV, PIL, NumPy, and SciPy.</td>\n",

The emails would be questions proposed by researchers or lifestyle data to look for correlations with product use, habits, physical traits and disease incidence.

Yes you would have to be thorough and careful about the anonymization, but I think the benefits could be there.  Correlation is not causation, though, and the nature of correlating a number of factors dictate you would get many false alarms. However, like a metal detector, the clues for new things to look at would be worth the false alarms.

It would have been lower, but I lurked for a year before actually signing up.  Then when digg and reddit came around I sort of abandoned \\/., the news on these new sites was NOW, and it was voted on by The People, not decided by The Editors.And then a couple of funny pics made the top stories, and that was a nice break from just news.  And then another funny pic, and then one I had just seen the other day, and then one from 1985, and then...I think the algorithms behind Digg and reddit, or the stories being promoted, show that as a whole society is pretty basic and easily entertained.  Hackers, BizDev folks, Founders - we are the minority out there.  When these progressive, techy, news-aggregator sites first emerged, they held \\&quot;our\\&quot; news, because \\&quot;we\\&quot; ran them.  Then, they were diluted as more (I&#x27;ll call them \\&quot;normal\\&quot;) people globbed on to the concept.  Soon, LOLCat pictures and videos of stupid stunts out rank a security flaw in FF, or news of a software project being acquired.This is where I think \\/. has the edge again, geeky-hacky-founder-types select the stories and weed out the LOLCat pics from the submissions.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s good for now.  Combine that with Hacker News, and some other \\&quot;underground\\&quot; news sites, and I guess we come to the conclusion that just as \\&quot;we\\&quot; stay on the leading edge of technology, \\&quot;we\\&quot; will have to stay on the leading edge of news sites as well.</td>\n",

              "            <td>There are many factors to consider in evaluating the value of a move.  Depending on the nature of your startup, it may be more or less valuable to make the move to the Valley.  Here&#x27;s a few factors that seem relevant to that evaluation.1. Access to capitalIf your company has large upfront capital requirements, then being in a setting with VC&#x27;s who aren&#x27;t afraid to take a risk has obvious benefits.  However, a lot of web 2.0 startups have relatively low starting costs. You can self-finance the development and launch of a product which attracts a rapidly growing userbase.  The main cost isn&#x27;t even monetary, its opportunity cost.  With this done, attracting VC interest is a lot easier, regardless of where you are.2. Access to talentNaively, the Bay Area has a lot more talent than other locations and this makes it a better place to do a startup.  Problem is, the competition for talent is a lot tougher.  If you&#x27;re a startup in a place with relatively few startups, you have a real shot at attracting the top programmers locally, because you&#x27;re the only game in town.  In the Bay Area you&#x27;re competing against Google, Facebook and all the rest.I&#x27;m in Waterloo, Canada, and this is evident locally.  Waterloo has a terrific undergrad CS program - supposedly, its Microsoft&#x27;s number one recruiting School - and lots of really talented developers.  But there are relatively few Web 2.0 companies in town, which means that startups have (if they&#x27;re willing to work at it) access to an amazingly talented pool of potential employees, and a real shot at hiring those people.I don&#x27;t think one even needs a top CS school locally.  My background is as a theoretical physicist, and my observation is that at least in theoretical physics the quality of the top students is pretty much the same everywhere.  I&#x27;d be surprised if there was much difference in CS.  There will be more extraordinary programmers in the MIT CS program, but they will still be there at Podunk State University, and if you&#x27;re careful and aim high, you&#x27;ll have a real shot at getting those people onboard.  3. CultureI don&#x27;t mean art and a nice orchestra.  I mean access to a \\&quot;can-do\\&quot; culture, full of sharp people who are plugged in, full of the latest news, insightful (and original!) analysis, and can act as role models, mentors, advisors, and so on.  Really sharp criticism and suggestions are worth their weight in gold.This is something where the Startup Hubs have a major advantage.  It also seems to me perhaps the biggest advantage of the YC program - the dinners and other events.  In places that are less of a Hub it seems to me that you need to consciously build a really wide network of people who can act in that role for you.  This requires work anywhere, but it is a lot harder in somewhere without a startup culture than it is in the Valley.4. Access to other companiesFor some startups it&#x27;s really important to have access to other companies for partnerships, distribution and so on.  For others it&#x27;s much less important.  Obviously, in the former situation being in a Hub has a major benefit, while in the latter situation it is less so.</td>\n",

If you live in the same place as them, even if you aren&#x27;t going to a startup-oriented social event, you still have a good chance of running into them and striking up a conversation.Case in point -- my cousin wants to make movies.  So he decided to move to LA and get a job as a bartender.  He went to bartending school and then got a job at a bar that is frequented by producers and other movie industry folk.  One day he served a drink to a producer, mentioned to the guy that he wanted to make movies, and is now working on a couple of movie deals.

              "            <td>This essay really strikes a chord with me.  In fact, I followed Paul&#x27;s advice about three weeks ago when I left Charlotte, NC to move to Sunnyvale, CA in hopes of starting a start-up (or at least working at one).  In non-hub cities, I would hear all the time about how I needed 10-15 years of experience to start my own company; maybe 1 out of 20 people would take me seriously.  (To tell the truth, most people would assume I was starting some sort of manufacturing-like company.  They would ask me where I was going to find the capital for such a huge investment).  That sort of negative energy can weigh on anyone, and I knew I had to get to a place where I felt more accepted for this ambition.On that topic, now that I have left my job (for the move), I would really like to get involved at a start-up out here.  I loved working my tail off while I was at college and hated (barely) working at work for the past year.  I really want to get back into nose to the grindstone working to build something cool.  Anybody have a good idea how to get the ball rolling.  I am teaching myself a few extra programming languages, but I feel like I need to get with the right people to get things off the ground.Anyway, great essay Paul.  Sometimes I wonder if the start-up companies will revolutionize \\&quot;work\\&quot; in a way that factories and unions changed the landscape of America during the 19th and 20th centuries.  Are we that far away from a start-up being the norm?  I suppose not everyone could work at a start-up, how could a start-up expand to a larger corporation if everyone is working at a start-up?  But, I could see the mentality switch such that students work for\\/start a start-up for 2-3 years after college, if it succeeds, great, if not, they go work for a larger company or go to grad school.  Either way, it sure would be nice to live in a society where everyone \\&quot;takes their shot\\&quot; before settling in to a nice, steady, safe career.</td>\n",

But the proximity to everything and everyone again makes up for a lot, especially for cuisine and nightlife. Driving is pain, housing is a pain.Milpitas is cheap, full of housing, but next to the city dump.

Everything closes early too, there&#x27;s no downtown or nightlife. Mountain View: tract homes suburban sprawl. Mountain View has one long strip called Castro street that masquerades as a downtown on certain days. Other than that it&#x27;s just old 60&#x27;s tract housing style (you&#x27;ll find this to be the case for almost all of Silicon Valley).Sunnyvale is like a pseudo commercial zone where all the warehouses and tiny offices are. Imagine playing SimCity and watching your purple zone languishing. That&#x27;s Sunnyvale. It&#x27;s definitely cheaper though to live because of this effect. There&#x27;s a Fry&#x27;s and Costco here, meaning you don&#x27;t need to go anywhere else. Cupertino\\/Saratoga has one big hit: Apple. There&#x27;s no downtown, everything closes at 9pm sharp. Cupertino is essentially where everyone commutes back to after working in SF or Sunnyvale. There are an abundance of police officers because of the odd arrangement the city has with the county to generate revenue. Saratoga is up in the hills which is pretty but basically excludes anyone without a seven digit network.Palo Alto is schizophrenic in that it doesn&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s a farm town, college town, ritzy retreat, or corporate shill. Stanford is here and the surrounding area outside of Stanford is great. Sand Hill Road is right outside, there&#x27;s a strip that act as the downtown, significantly longer than Castro. But because of Stanford it attracts quite a lot of companies to move here which in turn forces house pricing through the roof. Facebook is based here and they pay their employees an extra $600 to live within a 1 mile radius, meaning your chances are next to nothing to get a nice place. Watch out for East Palo Alto, that&#x27;s not a place you want to be.Santa Clara is like the ice cream center of a cake. It slowly melts into either layer but in the mean time it acts as the barrier between the sponge up top and the ghetto area on the bottom. This is where most people go because of the lower housing pricing due to market pressures. It&#x27;s not a bad area, but then again it&#x27;s not the sunny disposition you would expect California to be known for. This is also where my stolen car ended up at. Twice. East San Jose. This isn&#x27;t meant to be racist: east San Jose is where most of the poor live, there&#x27;s a huge Mexican and Vietnamese community here. This is also where the low-rent and section-8 apartments are and where most of the illegal immigrants will bus from to find work at Home Depot in other areas. This isn&#x27;t in any way to degenerate them, but this is just how the city is broken up into. Go more east and near the mountains and you end up at this ritzy and rich community called Silver Creek where they built thousands of big houses. You can drive for an hour here and still not see the main highway. San Jose itself is huge. In fact, it&#x27;s bigger than San Francisco, ranking itself as the 3rd biggest city in California. There&#x27;s a downtown, but it&#x27;s not as glamorous as say New York nor LA. Plenty of clubs to go to but it&#x27;s almost always full of cop cars, low riders, scrapers with big wheels, and sound system that&#x27;s enough to shatter glass. Quite a lot of companies are here though, Adobe for one, and the recent clamor for city living has caused quite a few skyscrapers to go up for loft living and the like. Prepare to pluck down more than $750k for a 900sq ft loft with sky high windows that look directly into a depressing airport. Oh, at least they have the courtesy to shut off the airport after 9pm (apparently everyone sleeps at 9 in Silicon Valley). There&#x27;s multiple museums though, but they have enough content to last you through maybe 3 weekends. \\nThis turned out more pessimistic than I had originally intended it to be. It&#x27;s not to say I hate Silicon Valley, but the wide-eyed optimism has worn off. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a dreamland, it&#x27;s just an certain area where lots of people have moved into. The new trend now is to tear down unoccupied commercial zones (caused by the first dot-com boom) and remaking them as condos. Expensive condos. It&#x27;s only getting more and more people to come in. Traffic is annoying. Stuff is expensive. There&#x27;s houses everywhere. And most areas lack charm. So in summation, where would I go?With a bit more money saved up, I would much prefer Palo Alto, it&#x27;s by far the best area, a 30 minute drive to the City (that&#x27;s what we call San Francisco) and close proximity to Mountain View. If I just need a cheap place to stay? Santa Clara. If I want to live the California life? San Francisco. If I have a family? Cupertino. If I really really really want to have a house? Milpitas. Don&#x27;t take this post as gospel though. I&#x27;ve only been living here for 15 years and can&#x27;t say I have truly captured ever nuance of Silicon Valley. \\nAddendum: Oakland. It&#x27;s in a renovation stage. What used to be a horrifying place to live at is now being revitalized for business and as a contra to SF. The popular trend amongst my friends and smaller startups is live in SF or Fremont\\/Union City and rent an office in Oakland. You can find a huge 1500 sq ft open loft\\/warehouse type office for less than $1.50\\/sqft. I still wouldn&#x27;t live in Oakland though.\\n</td>\n",

Right now the site is difficult to read, but that&#x27;s only because there is too much text too close together. The problem with super clean is that it gives the site an empty feel. Throw in a few gifs to give the site a little personality and it makes it feel like there&#x27;s something going on. You can always clean it up later, like what Amazon and eBay have done recently and MySpace will probably do in the future. Some might argue that eBay should have been cleanly designed from the very beginning, but personally I think the initial garish layout probably helped it to gain traction.The only trick is you still need a way to convey what the site is about, make it easy to navigate, and display whatever information the user needs to see on any given page.</td>\n",

I&#x27;ve found that rewrites can be a huge waste of time unless some key criteria are met:1) The code is broken.  If it&#x27;s broken, a rewrite is preferable to an involved patch.  What constitutes \\&quot;involved\\&quot; depends on time constraints and personal taste.2) I&#x27;m about to build on top of the old code.  If I&#x27;m going to extend or build on top of something I know is crap, I&#x27;ll rewrite it (time permitting).  Fixing it later will be substantially harder the more it&#x27;s used, so it&#x27;s best to fix it now.I&#x27;ve also become more restrictive in what I consider bad code.  Bad architecture and interface design are killer.  It&#x27;s nearly impossible to write something good on top of a crappy framework.For example, if a method body sucks, but the parameters and return type are fine, I&#x27;ll leave it be.  The implementation can be rewritten later if needed.However, if when writing some new code I find myself using a bunch of switch statements when the strategy pattern is more appropriate, I&#x27;ll fix it immediately.  It&#x27;s infinitely easier to fix such things when you&#x27;re adding the third concrete strategy than the sixth.Also, on a completely unrelated note, if you can implement everything they&#x27;ve done \\&quot;in a couple days,\\&quot; you&#x27;d better be getting founder equity.  Furthermore, if the code really is bad and they won&#x27;t acknowledge it, I&#x27;d high tail it out of there.

Even in this program, some courses were definitely more valuable than others.Not long past the point where it was too late to change majors, something astounded me.  I discovered a pattern to the valuable courses.  It was as follows:The most valuable high-level courses were the theoretical computer science courses (the foundations of CS series, AI stuff, the sort of thing where you&#x27;re asked, \\&quot;How would you solve this problem?\\&quot;).  The most valuable low-level courses were the concrete courses in things other than computer science (mostly math and physics; to a lesser extent, various engineering disciplines).  If you think about it, this actually makes sense:  the courses about solving problems, following the courses that give you the tools to do that.If you think about it, there&#x27;s a good reason for this:  Low level courses exist to provide a foundation for more advanced courses.  This means that they are not designed for people who already intuitively understand their subject matter.  If you already know C, Java, and two or three other languages like Pascal, you can learn Perl, Prolog, and Scheme on your own -- you don&#x27;t need a professor to teach them to you (though it might help to have someone get you to use macros).  You just need to understand that language&#x27;s \\&quot;thing\\&quot; (punctuation, assertions\\/derivations, first-class functions\\/closures\\/continuations) and then it will almost learn itself.  If you already know how to build a pointer-based binary tree, you don&#x27;t need a course to tell you how to build a radix tree, or a red-black tree, or a trie.On the other hand, the low level courses in other disciplines are designed for people who don&#x27;t already intuitively understand that area.  That makes them perfect for you.Unfortunately, most universities do try to curtail the obvious solution by enforcing prerequisite courses.  This makes little sense from a teaching perspective, but it makes perfect sense from a \\&quot;raising the average GPA of their students\\&quot; perspective.Almost anywhere you go, you&#x27;ll find the ability to game the system somehow -- be it alternate prerequisites, testing out of things, or taking a minor in CS instead of a major.  You need to be able to game the system to an extent.  Yet, that&#x27;s a valuable skill in itself.  Just optimize what you&#x27;re trying to learn, not the best way to get that piece of paper.</td>\n",

It is a big hole that takes years to become aware of. Another hard-to-see hole is what you take for granted in college or a tech-heavy city: where else are you going to meet other people with the same interests, work on problems with them, have late-night bull sessions, etc?So now that I live a few train stops from Berkeley I am taking some of the harder courses that people have said are worthwhile.Take the good stuff.

Right after graduation a degree is a valuable tool, in theory, that an employer can use to assess your value.  When you&#x27;re 45, your work experience and career accomplishments will\\/should outweigh any  degree(s) you might hold.  Of course, this is as related to tech-type jobs.  I sort of see this \\&quot;slider\\&quot; concept for measuring the value of a degree, as it related to most of the things relevant to what we discuss here.  The more entrepreneurial and hard-working you are, the less value a degree holds vs. real-time hands-on work experience.  The more you want to rely on a steady paycheck in a cube-farm, the more you should thing about getting that diploma.Some of the top wealth-holders in business and technology have no college degree (Slim, Gates, Ellison, Allen, Dell). Not to mention many more \\&quot;mid-level\\&quot; types who have done better than their peers, on-average, by virtue of hard-work and logical thinking.In your specific case, I would politely say that I question the potential for \\&quot;freelance web development\\&quot; to yield an ongoing income stream of appreciable value.

When I want to go to a local business, I don&#x27;t fly there.It always amazes me how geeks will ooh and aah over any 3D interface. But the three-dimensional world is extremely inconvenient for conveying most sorts of information -- there&#x27;s occlusion and perspective, which hide and distort information. The one thing a 3D map does convey is the height of buildings, and sometimes the shape, but it&#x27;s not clear that this is worth the costs. Even if it were true that 3D gave you more useful information, there are no interface standards for 3D navigation.Full disclosure: I work for Upcoming (http:\\/\\/upcoming.yahoo.com\\/), also in the events and local search business. But honestly, this isn&#x27;t me slamming the competition; I have ranted about 3D interfaces for years. I think UpNext is impressive, but maybe there&#x27;s more appropriate uses for this technology than local search.</td>\n",
